GeneralChatGnome |= I like to come here and smell the flowers. Much more 'earthy' don't you think?
GeneralChatGnome |= Busy busy!
GeneralChatGnome |= We are only here for the beer.

GeneralChatFairy |= Bless you, red-blood!
GeneralChatFairy |= Squee! It spoke to me! Wait until I tell the Circle!
GeneralChatDryad |= Am shopping like my leaf depended on it.
GeneralChatDryad |= Beware cannibal pine trees. They are coniferous.
GeneralChatDryad |= Corpses in copses. Their blood feeds the trees here.
GeneralChatDryad |= I love this thing called retail therapy.

GeneralChatDryad |= I hear orange is the new green.
GeneralChatDryad |= I was just in timber land.
GeneralChatDryad |= I need lumber support.
GeneralChatDryad |= I am shopping with my hedge funds.
GeneralChatDryad |= Not a shrubbery!

GeneralChatMossmen |= Just mossing about today.
GeneralChatMossmen |= I feel very sloe this fine day.

GeneralChatHomeGnome |= Flickerfin are such beautiful fish.
GeneralChatHomeGnome |= We Gnomes feel so tall here compared to your world.
GeneralChatHomeGnome |= We don't get many humans around here. You must be special.
GeneralChatHomeGnome |= I get sudden urges to sit by a pond showing my arse off.
GeneralChatHomeGnome |= We Gnomes are terrible at fishing, really.
GeneralChatHomeGnome |= Ancient Gnomes once ruled the gardens and ponds of humans.
GeneralChatHomeGnome |= Under this little hat is a little brain full of big ideas.

GeneralChatHomeGnome |= I tinker in the morning, and I tinker every night.
GeneralChatHomeGnome |= I am related to the singing Gnomes of Brightwall. LAAAA!
GeneralChatHomeGnome |= Start every day with a healthy breakfast.

GeneralChatHomeFairy |= Elemental, my dear human.
GeneralChatHomeFairy |= Our Fairy circle meets every Satyrday for cakes and syrup.
GeneralChatHomeFairy |= I like to act Seelie.
GeneralChatHomeFairy |= Puck off and dye your hair with those colours from the store.
GeneralChatHomeFairy |= I love comedy! Especially satyr!
GeneralChatHomeFairy |= Don't eat too many Sugar Plums. Not good for your elf!
GeneralChatHomeFairy |= Squee! Whee! Woopsieblump! I feel depressed today.
