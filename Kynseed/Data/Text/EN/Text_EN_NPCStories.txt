STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TEMPLATE_FRIENDLY |= 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TEMPLATE_LIKE |= 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TEMPLATE_NAME |= 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TEMPLATE_DESC |= 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TEMPLATE_START |= 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TEMPLATE_END |= 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_FRIENDLY |= 내 오랜 친구 잭이 생각나는군. 그는 재잘거리고 교활한 성격이었지. 항상 여자들에게 눈길을 줬어. 한 번은 이 새에게 깊은 인상을 남기려고 했었어. 문제는 새처럼 날 수 없다는 거였지.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_FRIENDLY |= 팬케이크를 만들 때마다 그 녀석 생각이나.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_LIKE |= 프라일은 통통하게 자란 채소를 정말 좋아해. 안타깝게도 대부분의 거대 식물은 식용이 불가능하기 때문에 장식용으로 남겨두는 경우가 많아.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_LIKE |= 예전의 블레이크가 생각나네. 블레이크는 항상 정원에서 벌어지는 일에 신경을 곤두세웠고, 너무 큰 일에는 당황하곤 했지.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_LIKE |= 마을 소녀들과 함께 뛰어다니던 어린 시절, 우리는 종종 그 녀석과 다투고 큰 호박 안에 숨기도 했어.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_LIKE |= 거대한 순무 속에 숨어 우리를 기다리다가 갇혀 죽었어. 먹어치우고 빠져나올 수도 있었지만 순무를 좋아하지 않았어. 고집은 우리 자신의 손가락을 자르는 칼이지.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_NAME |= 채식주의자 라니를 위해 구리 낫을 얻으세요
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_DESC |= 대장간에서 제작, 구매 또는 보상으로 구리 낫을 획득합니다.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_START |= 이제 우리는 절친한 친구인건가? 한 친구가 더 부유한 라이벌을 상대로 더 나은 기회를 얻도록 도와줄 수 있을까? 내 정원 꼭대기에 잠긴 문 봤어? 고대 구두공들이 갇혀 있어. 하! 옛날 구두수선공들이 잔뜩 있네! 하하! 사실 내가 도구를 보관하는 곳이야. 녹슨 쓰레기가 잔뜩 쌓여 있지. 멋진 최고급 낫이나 좋은 품질의 구리 낫을 구할 수 있다면 내가 더 많은 기회를 가질 수 있을 것 같아. 별 4개 이상이면 돼. 좋은 친구가 여기있군.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_VEG_RARNEY_END |= 와! 정말 예쁘네. 내 얼굴이 보여. 달 모양이네. 넌 진정한 친구야. 이제 저 부잣집 놈들과 품질 면에서 맞설 수 있을 것 같아!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_FRIENDLY |= 널 처음 봤을 때만 해도 너에 대해 확신이 없었어. 아마도 네 똥 냄새가 남들보다 더 달콤할 거라 생각했지. 넌 마치 세상으로부터 보호해주는 보이지 않는 속옷을 입은 것처럼 걷는 방식이 재미있었어.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_FRIENDLY |= Folk around here like things simple, including themselves. Tales of Fae dealings and all that energy, running around from pillar to post, well, it can just rub up the slower folk the wrong way.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_FRIENDLY |= It's fair to say I liked you from the start, though.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_LIKE |= Why do I dye my beard? It's my natural colour! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_LIKE |= But, seriously, when I first came here, I couldn't quite fit in. I had spent all my childhood in the Shoe.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_LIKE |= Came here without a brass penny or a stick of gum to my name.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_LIKE |= Started selling wildflowers and bits and bobs I found lying around. People were not keen on me due to my cheeriness. So to annoy them more, I dyed my beard green, as if to say, You can't change me to be who you want me to be.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_LIKE |= I think they respected that, and in time, they grew to like me and even liked my beard. It was a mark of defiance but then acceptance.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_NAME |= Collect 2 Hag's Eyes
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_DESC |= Gather 2 Hag's Eyes. These can be found as drops from any Hag type in Simplewood, Midwood or Toughwood.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= We are best friends now, aren't we?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= Am getting old and have been in my shop for many years. At first, you hate the walls, and then you get used to them. Finally, you rely on them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= I wish I was back on my first market stall. Summer was one fine season to be working outdoors.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= I suppose I should stick with tradition and give you some kind of task to seal our friendship?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= Well, let's make it easy for you. Just a couple of Hag's eyeballs will do. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= Hags killed my parents, apparently. The sisters took a liking to them, and that was that.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= So you can be my revenge. I know you can take them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= It's as the saying goes, 'Get busy killin' or get busy dyin'. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_START |= Doing a deed like that for a friend would prove you have what it takes. I am sure you can shank a Forest Hag easily.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_END |= You did it. I wouldn't have dared make it across the Simplewood border. Not a day goes by that I don't regret I didn't kill them myself.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_END |= I like to think the last thing that went through their heads, other than your sword, is that Rake Grassbeard was laughing at them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAKE_GRASSBEARD_END |= Thank you so much, friend.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_FRIENDLY |= It's good to know you.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_FRIENDLY |= I have had a long life full of adventure and misadventure.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_FRIENDLY |= Many a Hob have I slain. So many roads I have travelled.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_FRIENDLY |= I have loved, lost, lived, nearly died and lived again.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_FRIENDLY |= I am not very good at anecdotes, though, and it is a funny story how that happened.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= I was just thinking about that time I was smooching the fishmonger's daughter up in Tunt.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= Her father caught us and chased me with a cleaver. I hid up a pine tree and found a little door.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= I knocked on it, and a small fella answered. He waved his fist angrily and chased me with a cleaver.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= I dived into a river and nearly drowned. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= The fishmonger pulled me out and discovered I had caught a massive salmon in my shirt.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= He laughed and cooked up the salmon. As we ate it, I nearly choked on something.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= It was a ring the salmon had swallowed. I gave it to my loved one as a romantic gesture.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= Unfortunately, it was cursed and turned her into a salmon.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_LIKE |= So, I hid up the same pine tree.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_NAME |= Kill a Night Hag
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_DESC |= Kill a Night Hag. These can be found in Toughwood. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_START |= You are so great. You remind me of the time I was captured by a Hag and hung over her cooking pot, ready to be lowered in.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_START |= I told her that I knew a recipe that would make me taste much better. She was intrigued, and I said I would gather the ingredients needed.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_START |= When I returned, I made a broth for her. She tasted it, but I used my iron spoon, and she screamed and turned into a cat.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_START |= I know what you are thinking. Why didn't I use seasoning?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_START |= Anyway, you need a task, apparently.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_END |= Oh, you did it! Any exciting adventures to tell of?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_END |= Oh? Yes? You did what? Hmmm. Interesting!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_END |= Well, your stories are fun. Reminds me of the incident with the pig, ladle and a sack of flour.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPA_RUSS_EBERS_END |= Some tales are not meant to be told.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_FRIENDLY |= I am prepared to let you into our outer circle. You seem to want to better yourself, and what better way than to be amongst quality?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_FRIENDLY |= One can not just acquire wealth and expect to acquire class too.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_FRIENDLY |= Stick by me, and you may learn what it takes, although obviously, you can never be truly of quality with your background. You can, however, at least absorb some.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_LIKE |= Some folk are jealous of the wealthy. I do not know why, though. When I was a little girl, I wanted for nothing and was not jealous of others. I would sit and play with my dollies while daddy would be busy accumulating money and power.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_LIKE |= He worked hard so I would not have to.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_LIKE |= Then I was introduced to Greene, and although he was not of top quality, with an 'earthiness' about him, it was a good match. Like Daddy, he worked hard and even brought me a bucket of flowers. Hyacinths.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_LIKE |= I threw them away, of course, as I have to be keeping up appearances.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_NAME |= Buy any Business
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_DESC |= Buy any Business. Interact with the Ledger on the counter of any Smithy, Goods Store or Apothecary.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_START |= I do not know what it is about you, but despite your apparent lower-tier standing, you have a spirit emanating from you that tells me that you will own the world one day.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_START |= And so, I have decided that I can love you. But first, I think it would be of the proper doing for you to undertake a task for me to prove your class.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_END |= You proved your dedication and business drive. You might not have the manners, but you do have the manner.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MO_LAWN_END |= We shall now enter the love phase of friendship, and as long as you are rich and powerful, I will cherish you.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_FRIENDLY |= Why in the Goddesses name would you want to be friendly to me?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_FRIENDLY |= I am not complaining, mind! I am just a frumpy and lumpy housewife whose family has had a run of bad luck.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_FRIENDLY |= My philosophy is that we should make the most of the gifts we are given.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_FRIENDLY |= If we are meant to eat turnips, then we should embrace the fact we actually have turnips to eat.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_FRIENDLY |= Could be worse. Could be turnips I actually cooked.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_LIKE |= I know in these times it is all equality and men should be treated as equally as us women, but I do like to cook now and then.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_LIKE |= Problem is I am pretty terrible at it. It's not easy when all you have is a garden full of turnips and a few scavenged herbs. Might even be lucky and get a carrot on special days.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_NAME |= Make a Turnip Recipe
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_DESC |= Make a Turnip Recipe. Use a stove and look through your recipe book for something which needs Turnips. Yum.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_START |= You know what I'd love? A delicious meal to inspire me. You have good cooking skills by all accounts. Do you think you could help kindle my creative juices, as well as those in the cooking pot?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_START |= Any top-quality recipe with turnip in will do!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_END |= Delicious! Oh, you really caught the essence of the turnip there.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_END |= I never knew that the simple little veg we have in abundance could be so versatile.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KAT_TURNIP_END |= You are a true friend for opening my closed eyes. From now on, it's only the best in our house!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_FRIENDLY |= It takes a lot for me to trust someone. There is always someone wanting what's yours in this life, jealous of your success.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_FRIENDLY |= I made my success through hard work. Hard work and diverting the river and flooding the market with cheap goods so my rivals couldn't compete.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_FRIENDLY |= In business, you need to be as ruthless as an old straw-thatched cottage in a gale.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_FRIENDLY |= Then I spent my earnings making sure I had the best things and turned my attention to competitions. My giant veg are the best, and I have the most.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_FRIENDLY |= If you get to know me more, then my success might rub off on you, though that could just be our dog.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= I didn't always want to be a dragon of business. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= When I was young, I wanted to be a woodcutter.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= Leaping from tree to tree! As they float down the mighty rivers
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= of Pineshade! With my best girl by my side!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= The Oak!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= The Pine! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= The Giant Bunion Tree! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= The Sequin Oh-Ha! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= The Slightly Disturbing Face Tree! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_LIKE |= Oh, how we'd sing! Sing! Sing!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_NAME |= Take Greene to The Shingles
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_DESC |= Take Greene to the 4 locations marked by sparkling circles in The Shingles. Ask him to Follow by interacting and choosing the Follow option. Bring earplugs (not really).
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_START |= I'm a businessman, and I'm ok! I work all night, and I work all day.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_START |= I cut down prices, I sell you lunch, I charge for the lavatory.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_START |= On Turnsday, I buy out my rivals and have buttered scones for free!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_START |= Oh, sorry about that. I sometimes just get the urge to burst into song.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_START |= Tell you what, why don't we go on a trip to The Shingles? I can get amongst nature and release my inner self through song. It would be soul cleansing. What say you, trusted business associate?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_END |= Thank you, friend! That trip to The Shingles was just the release I needed. Anybody who works hard should always think about their mind and spirit and take time out, don't you agree?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_END |= We live in a crunch culture where people eat lettuce too loudly, and you just can't plan a good business venture with that noise.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_END |= Well then, back to the grindstone, although I would rather own the blacksmiths than run it.
NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_SONG_1 |= I'll be coming past the waterfall when I come! I'll be coming past the waterfall when I come! I'll be wearing pink pyjamas and beating up bad llamas, I'll be coming round the waterfall when I come! Lalala.
NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_SONG_2 |= Don't go chasing waterfalls... No need; they can't go anywhere.
NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_SONG_3 |= On top of old henge stones, all covered in Greene, I there lost my meatball, which nobody's seen. It fell off the capstone and under a bush. Now my poor sorry meatball is nothing but mush.
NPCSTORY_GREENE_LAWN_SONG_4 |= The Shingles are alive with the sound of music! And also the sound of midges and creepy noises coming from Midwooood! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NED_SCRUMPY_FRIENDLY |= I had a feeling we might get on well. I despair of my family. Father has ambitions but no follow-through. Mother has no ambitions and nothing to follow through. Jed just follows through.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NED_SCRUMPY_FRIENDLY |= I want to get out there into the world and earn my keep properly.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NED_SCRUMPY_LIKE |= Have you ever wanted to own a shop? I quite fancy doing that or even becoming a Chemist. Owning the Goods Store in the village is certainly a good idea. It is a great way to improve yourself, you'll see. I can see you making it way better than Icabod! We could work together; I'd be a great salesman! Ha!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NED_SCRUMPY_NAME |= 네드 스크럼피 고용하기
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NED_SCRUMPY_DESC |= 네드 스크럼피를 고용하여 상점에서 일하게 하세요. 장부를 사용하여 고용 탭으로 이동한 다음 네드 스크럼피를 선택합니다. 그런 다음 스케줄 페이지로 이동하여 일하도록 설정하세요!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NED_SCRUMPY_START |= Could you hire me sometime? I would love to work for you. I don't mind where just somewhere in the village where I can escape the 3 basket-ears.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NED_SCRUMPY_END |= Thank you so much for that! I believe in hard work and earning your keep. I have the work bug now, but that's just a beetle I caught on the counter. One day you may visit my own chain of shops. I'll call them, erm, Ned's Shoppe.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NED_SCRUMPY_END |= Imagination isn't my strong point.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_FRIENDLY |= 오, 너는 좋은 양파야. 양파는 재밌어, 그렇지? 이름만 들어도 웃음이 나고, 채소를 보면 눈물이 나지. 하지만 내가 거위만한, 그러니까 무릎 높이에 불과했을 때는 양파가 자라지 않았었어.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_FRIENDLY |= 어머니가 양파에 대해 전부 말씀해주셨지. 신맛, 쓴맛, 다층적인 맛. 하지만 어머니에 대한 이야기는 충분해.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_FRIENDLY |= 아버지는 어머니를 철의 여인이라고 부르곤 하셨지. 어머니의 직업은 초가집 짓는 사람이었어. 지붕을 아주 잘 치셨고 우리 모두를 내려다보는 걸 좋아하셨지.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_LIKE |= I like you in a way! You remind me of me when I was younger but different looking. You have strong facial features and very deep eyes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_LIKE |= Your teeth are like stars - they come out at night. Haha! Old jokes are the best.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_LIKE |= I once tried my hand as a wandering entertainer. I played the pubs and clubs throughout Quill. But, of course, at every pub, I got clubbed. Sometimes, my jokes were that bad.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_LIKE |= It's what drew Holly to me, I am sure. I could make her laugh, especially when I took out my glass eye and played marbles with it. Edna used to scream and hit me with the broom whenever I did that. No sense of fun, you see?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_NAME |= Upset the Teapotts
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_DESC |= Upset the Teapotts to lower their friendship level. Try various methods such as pouring poo, slingshot and hated gifts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_START |= You know how I told you about how I like a laugh and a joke? What would really tickle me pink is to see Edna and that young Edward getting a good old fashioned pranking.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_START |= If you can get one of them to dislike you, then I'd be happy as Larry. That was the name of my old comedy partner - Larry Load 'O' Laughs.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_START |= He died laughing. Anyhow! To business. The business of pranking!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IGNATIUS_KETTLE_END |= You would make a great stand-up comic because you are a real stand-up person, and you make me laugh to look at you. You did a good thing this day. You are what they used to call a Gillit. It was a type of blade and the best a man could get.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_FRIENDLY |= Is it official then? Are we on friendly terms?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_FRIENDLY |= I am glad to get to know you. I may be called Holly, but I am not prickly, really.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_FRIENDLY |= On the contrary, I consider myself the perfect blonde. Kind, smart, loving, sensual and generous with my time and affections.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_FRIENDLY |= You may hear terrible things about me from the Teapott's, but it is not true. I love my little Iggy-wiggy, and I find his diminishing memory and terrible hearing and eyesight extremely handy.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_LIKE |= I like you. You remind me of a bowl of honeyed porridge. Sweet, deep and mildly lumpy.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_LIKE |= I don't get much affection these days. Iggle-piggle is a kind and funny soul, but he often forgets my name. Luckily he also forgets he already gave me my allowance.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_LIKE |= At least he has an allowance to give. Edward was as poor as a peg and as tight as a gnat's nostrils.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_LIKE |= I resent seeing him happy with that old crone if I am honest.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_NAME |= Prank the Teapotts
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_DESC |= Prank the Teapotts to lower their friendship level. Try various methods such as pouring poo, slingshot and hated gifts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_START |= You fill up my senses like a night in dark forests. Like the mountains in summertime, like some pork in the rain. Like a storm or some dessert, like a sleepy old potion.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_START |= I am feeling very poetic today. Edward once wrote me a poem. It said, 'There was a young woman called Holly, Whose hair was a bit of a folly. Her lips tight and red, like she'd just kissed a peg, And then she married a right wally'.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_START |= He thought it was clever and charmingly romantic. I vowed to get him back.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_START |= In fact, could you do that? Could you annoy him a bit? Or Edna. I'll love you even more if you do!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HOLLY_KETTLE_END |= You managed to annoy Edward for me? You are a darling bud. May I kiss your cheek? That will show them who you really admire. Teapott's thought they had your affections in the bag! Pour me a cup of salted tears!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_FRIENDLY |= Good to meet someone so likeable. Always great to have an ally in this day and age. You never know who might be plotting against you. IT'S THEM! THE KETTLES!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_FRIENDLY |= Sorry about that. I just get so easily wound up like a beetle on a string.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_LIKE |= I am glad we are getting to know each other more. Just please don't let the poison tongues of others sway you. Keep a handle on those Kettles, basically.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_LIKE |= We didn't always used to be this way. I was married to Holly, and we moved in here. Then I saw how she looked at Ignatius. And she saw how I looked at Edna. We had some Hobbled Goblin, dinner, one thing led to another, and I realised I liked the smell of mustiness and the way light reflected off Edna's moustache. By that same end, Holly wanted a candy daddy, and so here we are.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_NAME |= Prank the Kettles
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_DESC |= Prank the Kettles to lower their friendship level. Try various methods such as pouring poo, slingshot and hated gifts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_START |= I have been thinking about you a lot. Not in that way. Yet. I think you could really help me out to get one over on the Kettles. Could you prank them?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_START |= Just get one of them to dislike you more. That'll show them that you prefer us and really get under their skin
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_END |= Ha! You properly pranked the Kettles! That showed them! Possibly. Am beginning to think we are a bit childish and that we have lost sight of what is important in life. Friendship, love, family.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_TEAPOTT_END |= Though I have to admit pouring poo in someone's house is really funny and brightens any day.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_FRIENDLY |= It's good to make a friend. At my age you need all the friends you can get. Very handy for nipping to the shops for you or helping light the fire. Bending down to poke the logs puts my back out!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_FRIENDLY |= Good job I have my lovely Edward. He can do all the handy jobs for me. He's much better than that horrible Holly and that blasted husband of hers.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_LIKE |= How are you faring, dearie? I am keeping myself busy, mainly watching those Kettles.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_LIKE |= Did you know I used to be married to Ignatius? Then a young couple moved in, Edward and Holly, and let's just say it got a bit messy. First, it was wandering eyes, then hands. Before you knew it, we had swapped partners. Ignatius and Holly can keep each other. He's a sour old goat, and she's a brass-digger.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_NAME |= Prank the Kettles
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_DESC |= Prank the Kettles to lower their friendship level. Try various methods such as pouring poo, slingshot and hated gifts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_START |= I'm not very happy, dearie. I keep looking out of my window and seeing them Kettles laughing at us. I think they need putting in their place. I cherish you as our best friend and don't want them stealing you off us across the way. Could you make them dislike you somehow? Put poo in their house, slingshot em; I don't care. You are OUR friend.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_END |= Wonderful! Oh, that poked them right in the eye. You are a star fallen from Aurore's ears.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDNA_TEAPOTT_END |= Here, take these. I won't be needing them after all.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BILLY_COWE_FRIENDLY |= You ain't so bad. I still think ya smell like something the cow ate last week, but maybe you are more fun than you look. Dad's no good and just likes going to the pub. I want to grow up to be just like him.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BILLY_COWE_LIKE |= Have you ever drunk strong drinks? What's it like? Dad says he can't remember, usually after he's been drinking. But I think Mum finds his secret supplies and has a whiffle herself.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BILLY_COWE_LIKE |= I probably shouldn't tell you that. You will think my family are all drunkards. No need to think it!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BILLY_COWE_NAME |= Prank the Cowes
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BILLY_COWE_DESC |= Prank the Cowes to lower their friendship level. Try various methods such as pouring poo, slingshot and hated gifts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BILLY_COWE_START |= Are you up for a dare? You are like, the best at everything. Could you pour poo in our house? It will make me laugh, and I'll give you a candy hare I have kept back for special occasions.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BETTY_SCRUMPY_FRIENDLY |= Did you know that people used to drink an apple-based grog called cider?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BETTY_SCRUMPY_FRIENDLY |= So, I told our Worzel we should make our own and sell it on the side. Or maybe by the front gate.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BETTY_SCRUMPY_FRIENDLY |= Passers-by could refresh themselves on the dusty road. Worzel said nobody comes by our farm, so it would be a stupid idea. He still has the bump from where I clopped him with the old roller.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BETTY_SCRUMPY_LIKE |= Did you know that I used to be the best pastry chef in all Quill? Of course you didn't! Why would you? It's not like I go around telling anyone, you know. Anyway, I once entered a pie in the Bake Off.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BETTY_SCRUMPY_NAME |= Bake Betty a quality pie
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BETTY_SCRUMPY_DESC |= Bake Betty a quality pie. Make sure to use high-quality ingredients and ensure the cooking goes well.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BETTY_SCRUMPY_START |= Say! Would you make me a top-quality pie that I can use as research? I just need a 4 or 5-star pie, any filling. Show me what you can do, and I'll love you like a fairy loves cakes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BETTY_SCRUMPY_END |= Oh, that pie looks scrumptious. Truly truly scrumptious. I shall make some for you like that - BANG BANG! I will mail them to you in a nice box when they are ready. Howes that sound?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ASH_BROWN_FRIENDLY |= 나는 최근 다양한 버그를 더 많이 찾아내느라 정말 바빴어. 나는 버그 수집광이라고 할 수 있지. 언젠가 내 설레는 비밀을 모두 공유할 수 있을지도 모르겠네!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ASH_BROWN_LIKE |= What got me into bug collecting? Well, it all stems back from when I was a little child. I can't have been more than four at the time, but I remember it like it was a few years ago. I was dipping my hands into porridge when a moth landed on my nose. It was the most beautiful shimmering green, and I went cross-eyed, staring at it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ASH_BROWN_LIKE |= I then grabbed it and ate it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ASH_BROWN_LIKE |= Since then, I have had an obsession with insects. I love to collect, identify, log, and sometimes snack on them. I do not recommend snacking, though - insects are meant to be for your dyes only!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ASH_BROWN_NAME |= Get Abdo-Mend for Ash
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ASH_BROWN_DESC |= Get Abdo-Mend for Ash. This can be obtained from any good Apothecary or crafted in one.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ASH_BROWN_START |= Oh, hello. As you are now my most cherished friend, I need your help. I captured a bug I hadn't seen before, and after I had noted it down and drawn it, I ate it. Unfortunately, it has made me rather ill. Could you somehow get your hands on an Abdo-Mend powder?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ASH_BROWN_END |= Oh, that's so much better. Thank you, <PlayerName>. My bug-collecting days are over, sadly. The hallucinations I had from eating that last one made me never want to touch any more again. Such an incident shows how life can change from the littlest moments. It was a warning from Morvenna for trying to catch something forbidden. Lesson learned. Thank you, my dear friend.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MILLY_COWE_FRIENDLY |= Are you now my friend? Does that mean we will be married one day? Ha! How disgusting! You've got a face like a cow bottom. Upside down. But you are Ok as far as upside-down cow buttfaces go.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MILLY_COWE_LIKE |= Did you know I have another brother? Ssshhh, I can't say who. I heard Mum talking about it, but I don't want to say in case the same happens to me!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MILLY_COWE_NAME |= Make Strawberry Jam for Milly
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MILLY_COWE_DESC |= Make Strawberry Jam for Milly. Collect the relevant berries and honey and use your stove.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MILLY_COWE_START |= I want to marry you! Ha! Not really. It's possible, though, maybe. You are not as ugly as a cow bum, really. Maybe you should prove how great you are by making me a lovely Strawberry Jam. The better it is, the more I will like you!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MILLY_COWE_END |= Thanks for that! I love jam so much. It's as sweet as you. And you really should try to find out more from Mum about my brother, if you haven't already!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_FRIENDLY |= Oh, my little ham sandwich! You are such a lovely crumble!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_FRIENDLY |= I get a lot of attention, you know, for my baps and pies?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_FRIENDLY |= Finn could never keep his hands off my goods.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_FRIENDLY |= Oh, bless me! Your little face has gone redder than a tart.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_FRIENDLY |= Best let you get on with your day, or there'll be thoughts of sticky pudding and jam roly poly!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_LIKE |= I do love me a bit of crumpet, and you are definitely one of those. Haha!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_LIKE |= Finn was always jealous if anyone else dared even come near my loaves.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_LIKE |= He was always a bit of a mummy's boy, but I liked that. He just needs a good smothering. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_LIKE |= Did I say smothering? I mean mothering.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_LIKE |= What happened to your parents, my little wafer biscuit?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_LIKE |= You don't know? Oh, you poor tiny souffle!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_LIKE |= Am sure one day you will find out. Best let you get on peachy pie!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_NAME |= Cook Risquebisque for Rosie
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_DESC |= Cook Risquebisque for Rosie. Use a stove when you have obtained the Recipe from Roger Readily's Heirloom Chest.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_START |= Have you ever met Roger Readily? He's a glass and a half of full cream milk if I ever saw one!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_START |= Fit as a baker's dog.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_START |= He once whispered to me that he has a very saucy recipe hidden away. I would love to get my doughy hands on it! It's called Risquebisque he says.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_START |= I was wondering, my little onion, if you could somehow seduce him enough to get that recipe off him and then cook me one? He probably has it hidden in his chest... and he has got a nice chest!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_END |= You made it! You got Roger's recipe! My mind wonders just what you had to go through to get it. Must have been terrible *wink*.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSIE_CRUST_END |= I look forward to tasting his goods. Thank you, my little pork pie.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_FRIENDLY |= The spirits give me a good feeling about you. And yet, there is also something else. Something intriguing. That's not necessarily bad! Let's say I think you have an interesting soul.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_FRIENDLY |= Would you like me to tell you your fortune? Read your palm? Gaze into a crystal ball? Scatter some bones? Horoscope? Water divining? Cup of tea?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_FRIENDLY |= Actually, I best not keep you. And I don't do those ancient occult things anyway. I just find you interesting and would like to get to know you more.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_LIKE |= When I was a little girl, I found a dead rabbit in a hawthorn bush. I noticed that it had one eye missing; poor mite. I picked it up, took it home and hid it under my bed. Every night I would talk to it and sing to it. I think I hoped it might suddenly wake up.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_LIKE |= When my mother found it, she was furious. "It belongs in nature to go back into nature!" she shouted, and she threw it back into the bushes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_LIKE |= A few years later, I heard a noise in the garden and looked out of the window. There was a rabbit sitting looking directly at me. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_LIKE |= I know what you are thinking. Did it have one eye?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_LIKE |= No, no it didn't. It ran off.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_NAME |= Give Rose a Morwenna Effigy
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_DESC |= Give Rose a Morwenna Effigy. Find one, win one or buy one.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_START |= I have another tale to tell you about when I was a young girl, dear. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_START |= My father would whittle wood to make little effigies to honour the Goddesses. I would play with them on the front step and pretend they were talking and eating together and controlling everything. Father would be sitting in his rocking chair, smoking a pipe, and as the sun set, the long shadows would creep across the garden.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_START |= Idyllic times.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROSE_THORN_START |= I still have the wooden effigies in my keepsake box, but one is missing. Morwenna, Goddess of Beasts. If you could help me get one, I would truly know your spirit is true.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_FRIENDLY |= OK, I will be your friend, but I am not the kind of man for nonsense.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_FRIENDLY |= However, it could be good business in the long run, and you seem dependable.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_FRIENDLY |= I can tell you have a business soul. I am sure one day you will be running an empire that spans from over there to beyond that tree over there.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_LIKE |= 공짜로 알려주지. 넌 퀼의 소금 같은 존재야. 그게 내가 내 브라스를 만든 방법이야. 채광 소금, 구리, 주석 세상이 좀 더 평온하고 현명한 사람들이 사방에 널려 있던 전성기 시절이었지. 드루이드, 현자, 구루들. 좋은 친구들이 많았고, 그들은 내가 가진 것을 많이 사주었을 뿐만 아니라 소문을 퍼뜨리는 데 도움을 주었지.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_LIKE |= Slowly, they became less and less, so I cashed in and retired as a rich man.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_LIKE |= I do miss the scratch of quill on parchment and the way the brass scales shone by candlelight as I did the accounts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_NAME |= Buy any business
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_DESC |= Buy any business. Interact with the Ledger on the counter of any Smithy, Goods Store or Apothecary.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_START |= I have a proposition for you now that we are pretty much business partners, but without the business. If I gave you the money, could you buy a shop and run it for a day? I want to see just how good you are and if there is money to be made.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_START |= I have Brass to spare, so it is pocket change, and I believe you have what it takes to enter the dragon's den, not as an apprentice and be a success.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_START |= Report back to me the day after, and let's see where it's at.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_END |= Hmmm, interesting accounts. It's not a viable concern, really. I think mining is where it's at.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_END |= Keep the shop if you wish, or sell it. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_END |= I have a new little secret hobby anyway to flitter away my pennies. Animals races! Just got to love battling the odds, working out the form and gauging everything from mood to mud to wind speed.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROCK_SALT_END |= Anyway, thanks again. You are a good investment.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_FRIENDLY |= Yes! A new friend! I love collecting friends like I do nail polish.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_FRIENDLY |= I bet you think it's strange that I work here and I am nothing like a blacksmith?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_FRIENDLY |= I told my father that I wanted to work with nails, and he said I should try here. I didn't know it was a blacksmith's til I got accepted by Hannah.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_FRIENDLY |= I meant fingernails!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_FRIENDLY |= If only we could combine the forge with some sort of manicure shop. The dream.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_LIKE |= Do you think my hair looks good? Hannah says it always looks really shiny and healthy. I think it must be due to where I grew up as a kid.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_LIKE |= I am the daughter of a family from Pineshade up in the north, you see? Around there, it is all beautiful scented pine trees and clusters of fragrant wildflowers. I would forage and use what I could find to make beautiful shampoos.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_LIKE |= My hair seems to have survived the smoky forge, so it must be top quality, don't you think? All those shampoos!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_LIKE |= I used to visit my parents up there and forage, but when the bridge to the north collapsed, I couldn't get to see them. I heard a dragon did it, and nobody dared fix it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_LIKE |= I bet its breath is not as hot as Hannah's forge!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_NAME |= Get Pink dye for Nerys
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_DESC |= Get Pink dye for Nerys. You can buy it or win it from places you must discover yourself!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_START |= You are a real sweetie, and I feel like we really connect, don't you think?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_START |= I tell you what would really make me love you lots more - colours!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_START |= I love making dyes, but I am missing a beautiful pink colour. If you could ever get me a bottle of pink dye, I would be over the Moon God.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_END |= Woah! It's amazing! Pink to make the boys wink! It's to dye for!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_END |= Smells like nothing else in Quill, too. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_END |= I would love to open a shop selling dyes, but Hannah has been so kind to me, so I don't want to let her down.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_NERYS_NAIL_END |= Thank you, wonderful, wonderful you!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_FRIENDLY |= Aren't dogs great? You seem friendly, but dogs always have a wag of the tail and a large amount of drool ready when they see you.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_FRIENDLY |= Did you know that the Goddess Morwenna has a pet dog? 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_FRIENDLY |= I could tell you all kinds of dog facts. I would invite you to an evening of dog lectures, but I don't like having people in the house - just dogs.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_LIKE |= You must think I am a crazy dog-man. Well, I am crazy for dogs and a man.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_LIKE |= I heard there was a lady in your Vale who was cool for cats. It sounds like she would like a friendly squeeze. Or is it a hug? I am not very good when it comes to that sort of thing.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_LIKE |= I just know how to give the dog a bone.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_NAME |= Give Kane 10 bones
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_DESC |= Give Kane 10 bones. Get a dog and a shovel and dig up digspots to try find them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_START |= I like you more than any other human I have talked to, which is not many. Do you have any bones? I could do with stocking up. About ten will do.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_START |= It would show me you really care for dogs. You know how to get them, don't you? Dig them up. You need a dog and a shovel of course.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_END |= Those are good bones.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_END |= I never told anyone this, but I was rescued by a dog when I was a little boy. We were on a picnic, and I crawled into a rabbit hole, and nobody could find me. Then a man was walking past with a dog, and the dog found me and dragged me out of the hole. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_END |= All I really remember is my mother saying, "Thank you, wee lassie".
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KANE_HINES_END |= My parents then bought a dog to help protect me. We called it Cuckoo Joe. My Dad Stephen said it was the king of all dogs. I just remember asking what a king was.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_FRIENDLY |= It's wonderful to know you. Herbie and I do love connecting with the right kind of people.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_FRIENDLY |= I met him a few years ago when I found him dancing whilst some bemused mice watched on. So I sat and watched myself for a while, and he eventually climbed a tree and fell asleep.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_FRIENDLY |= I just love his free spirit. He wants to just connect to nature and expand his mind. He might not be the sharpest sacrificial knife in the cupboard, and he looks like he hasn't slept for 400 years, but he has character and a lot to give.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_LIKE |= Do you ever dream of seeing inside Opal? It must be so beautiful there. Some believe the walls are all jewels, and there are fountains of nectar. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_LIKE |= Herbie thinks if he can concoct the right potion or powder, then he might be able to peek inside. He says Opal isn't a physical place. I hope he is careful and doesn't travel somewhere he can't get back from.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_NAME |= Take Ivy to Tir Na Nog
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_DESC |= Take Ivy to Tir Na Nog. Use the Follow command on interact and take her to the sparkling circles in that realm.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_START |= I dream of travelling to places that are just so magical that they leave a mark on your mind forever. I want to go to these places in reality, though, not in the mind.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_START |= Do you know anywhere we can go? Could you take me on a tour of somewhere magical?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_END |= Thank you for sharing that dream with me. I know it wasn't real, but it felt so tangible. I had an amazing time wherever that was. I will see it every time I close my eyes. Thank you.
NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_LINE_1 |= That is a very pretty lantern. The light from it seems to bounce around my soul.
NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_LINE_2 |= This place is dark and mysterious. What flora! There are mushrooms here that Herbie would love!
NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_LINE_3 |= This is so pretty. I love the waterfalls and pink ponds and huge trees and the colours of everything.
NPCSTORY_IVY_WEED_LINE_4 |= What is that? It's so cute! Oh, this place is amazing!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_FRIENDLY |= Woah, man! Good vibes!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_FRIENDLY |= It reminds me of that time I fell asleep in a rainbow mushroom patch. I woke up, and all the trees were really friendly. I danced with some fieldmice, and they made me a hat from cobwebs.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_FRIENDLY |= It was, like, amazing. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_FRIENDLY |= That's when I met Ivy. She found me upside down in a tree, asleep.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_FRIENDLY |= I told her what happened, and she told me all about the effects of certain fungi.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_FRIENDLY |= That's when I knew I had to marry her, and from that, we made a business using her knowledge of medicinal plants and my ability to test the results without exploding.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_LIKE |= I like you, man. You remind me of me before I developed a taste for exploring the realms of expansive thought.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_LIKE |= Do you think there are civilisations that dwell in the depths of our thoughts? Imagine that, a village of beings hiding away beyond the edges of consciousness, feeding off our imagination.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_LIKE |= I also think the world is shaped like a mushroom, and we live on top of it. I would love for the Goddesses to reach down and pick me up so I can see what Quill looks like from up there.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_NAME |= Get a rainbow mushroom for Herbie
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_DESC |= Get a rainbow mushroom for Herbie. These can be found growing around the world. Use your Proverbs section in the inventory if you need help.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_START |= I think I might be able to view the land from the sky. However, it requires a high-quality rainbow mushroom. Do you think you could get me one? The ones I find are just not up to snuff.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_START |= A 4 or 5-star I think, could propel me into the stars.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_END |= Wow! Thanks, man! You are a steadfast supporter of the chemical arts. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBIE_WEED_END |= Keep your eyes on the skies and see if you can see my mind swimming up there.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_FRIENDLY |= Are you trying to befriend me because you like being around strong women?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_FRIENDLY |= I come from a long line of powerful smiths. I am convinced I am a descendant of The Wright, one of the Grandmasters. And fables of old tell of a strong woman called Hammer who quested with some hero in a realm far away. I changed my surname in her honour.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_LIKE |= Do you want to know the riddle of steel?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_LIKE |= Flesh ages and withers. Steel becomes weak. True strength comes from within you. A sword can cut through flesh, but a hand must wield the sword. Without the iron will to grasp the sword and be prepared to cut through flesh, then they are nothing.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_LIKE |= I don't fight monsters, but I do fight the demons of the mind. Every day I hammer at the anvil, and each blow is my way of showing my strength. Smithing is in my blood, and my blood is full of iron.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_NAME |= Get Shadderwryth for Hannah
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_DESC |= Get Shadderwryth for Hannah. Shadderwryth is an ore that you must try to locate yourself. Use relevant Proverbs if you need help locating it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_START |= Your friendship glows like my forge. I bet you did not think when you first saw me that I would be so poetic?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_START |= Appearances can be deceptive. I may look like I crush diamonds into dust between my shoulder blades but inside is a warm foundry.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_START |= Hey! I always want to prove to myself that I am strong, so I have been thinking.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_START |= All I seem to work with here is copper, tin, some zinc and iron. I have heard of Fae metals that are not only hard to shape but attempt not to be forged, as though they are alive.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_START |= If you ever find any, I would honour your name each morning as I fire up the coals with the bellows. And give you some Brass.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_END |= Incredible! Look at how it glimmers. It seems to shift and move as you look at it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_END |= I shall make something beautiful with this.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HANNAH_HAMMER_END |= You have shown me the true strength of friendship.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_FRIENDLY |= You seem a spirited sort. Like adventuring, do you? I bet you have seen some sights.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_FRIENDLY |= Me? I like things a bit quiet. A nice simple life. I need to look after Daisy. She's all I have other than my health, my heart and a good solid bed.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_LIKE |= I wasn't exactly straight with you previously. I might like the quiet life now, but I used to be an adventurer. Yes, I had a sword, and I used it many times when out in Simplewood. Those dark forests are strange places. You go near one, and it's like the trees beckon you in and sing you a wordless song. You get drawn to find out what is in there.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_LIKE |= I was a pretty good slayer of monsters, and so was my wife. But sadly, she was drawn to Toughwood. I tried to reason with her, but she insisted. I looked after baby Daisy and the wait was awful. She returned but mortally wounded. I vowed revenge but never stepped into the woods again.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_NAME |= Slay a Night Hag
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_DESC |= Slay a Night Hag. These can be found in Toughwood. It's tough, so watch out!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_START |= It was the anniversary of my wife's passing recently. I keep wanting to slay a Night Hag in her honour. Well, honour and revenge.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_START |= If you ever wander into Toughwood and encounter one of those evil witches, please say hello from me, and if you kill it, I will reward you handsomely.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EDWARD_WOOD_END |= You did it? Incredible. That gives me some peace. My wife would surely be thanking you, too, in whatever form she is in now. I hope that witch had a shocked look on her face as you ran her through. You have done a great deed, dear friend.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_FRIENDLY |= An honour to meet a fellow fancier of cakes. The soft sponge reminds me of resting my head against my mother's chest and falling asleep. She would wake me with a start. "Finn!" she would cry, "You are 32. Can you stop doing that?"
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_FRIENDLY |= I think age should be no barrier to enjoying the things that make us comfortable. That's why I married Rosie. She's as soft and spongy as those golden syrupy days gone by.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_LIKE |= What got me so into baked goods? Well, it's all nostalgia. That's an ancient word that means 'nose tingles for an age' or something. When you get older, you yearn to be younger. Many things can set off a memory of happier, more innocent times. A smell like baking bread. Hazy sunlight above the wheat late in the afternoon. The trickle of a stream or the feel of something warm to remind you of home and family, and laughter.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_LIKE |= I am going to cry! I need a cake cure!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_NAME |= Bake a high quality Gummyyum Pie
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_DESC |= Bake a 4 or 5-star Gummyyum Pie. Use any stove and the correct recipe.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_START |= My skill as a baker only goes so far. And the ingredients I can obtain are limited. Your Vale has the best fruit. Mellowfields has the best veg. We don't get much around here except gooseberries.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_START |= I would love to taste a pie made from ingredients found outside the Havens, and outside this realm.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_START |= It is common knowledge the Fae have access to all sorts of sweet fruits that a man can only dream of.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_START |= On your travels, if you were ever to find such delicacies, could you make me a pie? A lovely high-quality Fae pie. Hmmmm.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_START |= I will be forever in your debt!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_END |= Amazing! Oh, that smell! It instantly reminded me of when I was little, playing under a tree. There was a hole in it and a smell drifting out. This smell!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_END |= It is all coming back to me, clear as crystal cupcakes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_END |= I recall a little voice from within the darkness of the hole as I peered into it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FINN_CRUST_END |= It said, "Oi, getcher big nose out of it ya big scrawny scarecrow!" Well, I got to taste your pie in the end, you little faery flapjack!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_FRIENDLY |= Hoho! A good ally to have indeed! You aren't a spy, for you know who, are you?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_FRIENDLY |= I trust ya.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_FRIENDLY |= If it's not envious neighbours pricking my pumpkins, it's mischievous Fae gumming up my windmill blades.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_FRIENDLY |= I grew up in a household that took no nonsense. If we were silly, then we'd be put into the larder and locked in.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_FRIENDLY |= That wasn't actually that bad as the larder was a walk-in and stuffed with food.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_LIKE |= Do you want to know the secret of growing the shiniest, plumpest veggies?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_LIKE |= All you need is love.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_LIKE |= It also helps to remove any beetles, of course.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_LIKE |= You need to wait for a nice day, say here comes the sun, get back away from the light and just let it be. Then you have to come together with your veg and twist and shout as you uproot them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_LIKE |= After that, it's a long and winding road to the market to sell them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_LIKE |= For the bigger veg, I get by with a little help from my friends or use a wagon, but they are bumpy and can give you cart knee. Oh no!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_NAME |= Give 10 Pumpkins to Frogg
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_DESC |= Ken Tiller has asked you to give 10 Pumpkins to Frogg. You can harvest, buy or grow them yourself.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_START |= I need your assistance on a delicate matter.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_START |= The vegetables that I had ready to deliver have gone missing.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_START |= It's probably sabotage, but I have no proof.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_START |= Could you make a delivery for me? Unfortunately, I don't have any veg to give you, but if you could take 10 pumpkins to Kooky Burrows in Outlane, I would pay you 50 Brass.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_START |= Money isn't as important as reputation!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_END |= Much appreciated. It is a great thing in this life to have a true friend who makes all the effort worth it. Sometimes you need to just relax and stop dashing around and see the beauty in things.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_KEN_TILLER_END |= As momma used to say, take your time, young man, don't rush to get old and take it in your stride. Live your life, junior!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_FRIENDLY |= I have so many questions! What kind of music do you like? Who is your favourite bard? Do you play any instruments?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_FRIENDLY |= I am still hoping to one day become just like Lyric. Isn't she just the coolest person ever?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_FRIENDLY |= I have so many questions for her too, but I don't think she meets fans.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_LIKE |= Yay! You like me!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_LIKE |= That's at least two fans I have now, you and Thomas. He has been so good to me, let me stay in his house, and doesn't mind who I am.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_LIKE |= It is important to be yourself and not feel like you have to justify existing!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_LIKE |= That said, please keep liking me and subscribe to my taste in music. The people around here are such old fuddy-duddies. They only like lutes and chants.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_NAME |= Play music with Star
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_DESC |= Take Star to the interior glade area in Mellowbrook and play the lute. Use the Follow command on interact to lead her there.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_START |= It's amazing! You are my biggest fan, and I am yours!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_START |= Seems you are the more popular around Quill, though. What is your secret?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_START |= I think people judge me 'cos of my hair and energy. Thomas says my hair looks like Fairy silk.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_START |= He's such a poet, but he doesn't know it!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_START |= Do you want to go somewhere and jam? And after we eat jam, you could strum a lute, and I can sing!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_END |= That was great fun! You play the lute beautifully. I could get used to that; it is intoxicating!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_END |= Am not sure I could perform in front of a big crowd, though! It was hard enough with just you and those dancing squirrels.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_END |= I think they were squirrels. Anyway, thanks! You are a star too!
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your girl,
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= You win some, lose some, all the same to me,
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= The pleasure is to play; makes no difference what you say,
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= I don't share your greed; the only tool I need is the 5-star Spade,
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= The 5-star Spade!
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= Playing for the high one, dancing with the Fae,
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= Going with the flow, it's all a game to me,
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= Zinc or Iron, Knocker eyes watching you,
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= Double yield or quit, double ore or split, the 5-star Spade,
NPCSTORY_STAR_SAPPHIRE_SONG |= The 5-star Spade.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_FRIENDLY |= Well met! Friendship level gained! I must have rolled a double 6 when you came into Mellowbrook. Good friends, good drink and a good game of dice are the things that make one happy.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_LIKE |= Do you like the sound of dice rolling across a table? The tap-tap of little clay adventurers as they move across the board? The shuffle of cards and the luck of the Goddesses?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_LIKE |= I love losing myself in such games as Mono Roly Poly, Disconnect Foreheads, Broomraven and Ticket to Ride Pigs.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_LIKE |= I dream of one day converting the tavern into a board game tavern, where the drinks and dice roll across the table and strategy mixes with vomit in the sawdust.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_NAME |= Take Steef to Tir Na Nog
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_DESC |= Get Steef to follow using the Follow command and go to Squeal or No Squeal game house in Tir Na Nog.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_START |= Do you know what would really put the token on the winning score track for us? A trip somewhere together to find a really fresh game. It doesn't have to be a dice game, board game or an exciting adventure book.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_START |= I bet the Fae play some crazy games.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_START |= If you could take me to experience a really great game of chance, not silly ball throwing or anything dextrous, then I'd let you be DM on our next session of Advanced Advances & Advancements.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_END |= That was really interesting! Tir Na Nog, no less, and a game of luck with what looked like disturbingly real balloons.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_END |= I think I prefer dice and figures, but it was very inspiring to witness something so unique.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_END |= And because it is Fae, I am sure I won't remember it when I get home, and none of this would have happened.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_STEEF_JAXON_END |= You get a plus 10 to friendship!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_FRIENDLY |= A blacksmith needs friends in these troubling times. Dark things are afoot. I don't mean the soot on my boots!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_FRIENDLY |= I didn't always want to be a smithy, you know? Instead, I fancied myself as a hunter or tracker or just investigating things using detective work.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_FRIENDLY |= A lack of crime in Quill sort of spoils that, though.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_FRIENDLY |= Oh, just one more thing before you go. You have some soot on your nose.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_LIKE |= Did I tell you about the time I investigated the case of luggage? That was a lot to handle, let me tell you!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_LIKE |= Or the Basket of the Houndvilles? That one was no picnic!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_LIKE |= The Curious Button of Benjamin Case. That was a man who found a rusty button, but over time it got cleaner until it was gleaming.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_LIKE |= It turned out a Brounie had been polishing it in secret.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_LIKE |= And who could forget the Case of Undercooked Chicken Bought No Questions Asked? That one had me up at night for a while!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_LIKE |= Oh, before you go, just one more thing. Your shoelaces are tied.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_NAME |= Solve the anagram
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_DESC |= Solve the anagram - GOGGLE DEN and gift that item to Thomas... if you can find one!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_START |= Am I glad you are here! I am in the middle of a most perplexing puzzlement that presumes pre-emptive pondering and posturing.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_START |= It is a nine-letter puzzle. It is a real conundrum. A real word hurdle. Maybe if you can work it out and give me the thing you think it is, then this will be another case solved for Steel and... whatever your surname is.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_START |= What is your last name, by the way?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_START |= Really? That's unusual.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_START |= So, can you crack this most enigmatic egg of an enigma?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_END |= That's it! You cracked the case but not the egg, thankfully! A golden egg at that.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_END |= Who sent the puzzle?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_END |= Oh, I don't know! I shall investigate that myself. I need to show off my investigative chops!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_END |= That's the pig I use to sniff for clues, so don't judge me.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_END |= Thanks again.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_END |= Oh, just one more thing. You are amazing. But you still haven't sorted that soot or those shoelaces.
NPCSTORY_THOMAS_STEEL_GOOGLE_DEN |= GOGGLE DEN
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GINGER_NUTT_FRIENDLY |= 나를 알아가려고 노력해줘서 고마워. 내 이름을 비스킷에서 따온 거 알아? 홉 크런치 월리 너트라는 사람과 결혼하면서 이름을 바꿨어. 그는 죽었어, 알지? 맞아, 낚시하다가 사고가 나서 호수에 빠졌어. 그는 흠뻑 젖어 밖으로 나왔고 5일 후 님프와 레슬링을 하려다가 물에 빠져 죽었지.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GINGER_NUTT_FRIENDLY |= Our Hazel loved him as a Dad. She blamed me for his death, then ran off with a wanderer called Hugh Jarsoul.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GINGER_NUTT_LIKE |= Have you spoken to Hazel lately? Turns out her fella lived up to his name. Sent her doolally it did. Became a cat lady. She loves nothing else but those cats, not even her old Mum.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GINGER_NUTT_NAME |= Give Silver Pendant to Hazel
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GINGER_NUTT_DESC |= Give the Silver Pendant to Hazel Nutt.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GINGER_NUTT_START |= I can't leave this world without letting our Hazel know I still love her, even though I hate cats.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GINGER_NUTT_START |= Could you take her this pendant? It used to be her Dad's. It must have belonged to someone else once as it says Sterling Silver on it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MELANIE_JUGG_FRIENDLY |= Has my Dad spoken to you? I can sense something is wrong. I'm just not sure what it is. You have the air of someone who people can confide in. Could you talk to him? I need to know what irks him so. I see him smiling and joking with the customers, but I can feel his soul is as empty as the keg come closing time.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MELANIE_JUGG_LIKE |= [LETTER]NPCSTORY_MelanieJugg_1
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MELANIE_JUGG_NAME |= Give 3 x Barley to Melanie
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MELANIE_JUGG_DESC |= Give 3 x Barley to Melanie. You can buy it, win it or grow your own.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MELANIE_JUGG_START |= I searched deep inside my soul for an answer as to what was troubling my Dad. I prayed to the Goddesses and made extra offerings. It was then that I had a dream that gave me the message I needed to hear. Ambition had consumed me. I was so eager to be my own person that I forgot what was essential in life - family and happiness. So, I talked to Dad, and we had a great heart-to-heart over a nice warm brew. To that end, I will craft a new drink in his honour, 'The Toby Topper'. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MELANIE_JUGG_START |= Could you help me craft the drink by getting some Barley? I need three lots and will pay you well for your help!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOBY_JUGG_FRIENDLY |= My Melanie is a good lass. She works hard and keeps the Ledger up to date. Yet, I can't get my head around it, though. You see, when I ran the pub, it was spit and sawdust, the clang of coins, and I shoved the day's earnings in an old bag. People had fun, and the spilt drinks would soak your boots. Now, it is all orderly and 'managed'. I have to admit I prefer the old way.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOBY_JUGG_LIKE |= I know I often seem jolly and rosy-cheeked, but I am a twisted grump inside. I hate seeing my old pub become some clean, efficient money-making machine. Melanie will put fancy artwork on the walls and hang chairs and scythes from the rafters next. It's dragging me down; it really is.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOBY_JUGG_NAME |= Give 3 x Barley to Toby
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOBY_JUGG_DESC |= Give 3 x Barley to Toby. You can buy it, win it or grow your own.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOBY_JUGG_START |= I chatted with our Melanie and cleared the air. I couldn't hold it back any longer. I know I am an old man, set in his ways, and she is just running it the way she needs to. To that end, I will create a new drink in her honour, 'The Melanie Mellow'.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOBY_JUGG_START |= Could you help an old fool out and find me some Barley? It's been in short supply around here lately. Three lots should do.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPPY_COWE_NAME |= Get milk for Pappy from a Bumbabloopfnoop
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPPY_COWE_DESC |= Get milk for Pappy from a Bumbabloopfnoop. This is a strange Fae creature. Use a jar or bucket when next to one.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPPY_COWE_START |= Oi, you! I need to ask yer sommat. I have a problem, see. I love milk. I can't get enough of the stuff. Cow milk is acceptable, but its creaminess is limited. What I need is the right kind of creature to milk. And that is where you come in.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPPY_COWE_START |= I heard a rumour you know how to see the Fae and visit them. I also know from being old and well-read that a fairy creature exists, the Blobbalobbadobba or something silly like that. The milk from one of those is richer than the Lawne's of Mellowfields. I would love to sup on that before I perish and likely come back as a newt.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPPY_COWE_START |= If you could get me some milk from one of those, then you can have the code to my own family secret box. My terrible family don't deserve to get their hands on my heirloom!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAPPY_COWE_END |= Thanks for that. You ain't such a bad one. Every time you bring me a bucket or jar of that stuff, I will pay you 10 Brass. Sound fair?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAT_COWE_FRIENDLY |= You are sort of likeable in a way. You definitely make an effort, unlike our Tom. Ever since he had that run-in with the Knockers and gave up mining, he's been as bitter as that stuff he drinks.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAT_COWE_LIKE |= Seeing as we are getting to know each other more, I will let you in on a little secret. We actually had a child before we had our Milly and Billy. Something bad happened to them. Oh, but I have said too much. Just nice to have someone sober to talk to, if you know what I mean?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAT_COWE_NAME |= Give Pappy Cowe Simpletons Stew
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAT_COWE_DESC |= Cook a 3-star or higher Simpletons Stew for Pappy.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAT_COWE_START |= I may have sneaked some of Tom's secret drink stash, and my lips feel looser than a pair of trousers on a Remnant. I told you before that we used to have a child. In some ways, we still do.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAT_COWE_START |= We had a kid called Peppy. Silly beggar was a wild one. Only went and had a pee against a Goddess Statue. So they punished him and made him old. Yep, that's Pappy. Loves his milk like he was still seven. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAT_COWE_START |= Anyway, I suppose you are after some sort of task to prove your friendship? I was thinking old Pappy never really gets any roughage, so perhaps you could make him a top-quality meal like a Simpletons Stew?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PAT_COWE_END |= Thanks for doing that? I hope it gave him a proper lining for his milk-addled stomach.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_FRIENDLY |= Do you have any pets? I had a cat once. It sat on the mat all day. Then Dad sat on it by accident, and it became a flat cat on the mat. What a prat!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_FRIENDLY |= I love rhymes, don't you know? And jokes. And jokes that rhyme. Dad says I have funny bones inherited from him. That does sound pretty awful.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_LIKE |= Dad likes playing jokes on Mum and me, but Mum can't stand them. I think it's ever since he put a spider in her shoe. As she went to put them on, he smashed a cream pie into her face and then threw her shoe in the fire.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_LIKE |= Dad was still learning about pranks at the time and wasn't very good at them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_NAME |= Find the buried necklace
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_DESC |= Find the buried necklace. Use a dog and shovel to discover digspots and dig at the mound the dog finds.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_START |= Dad has annoyed me and buried my copper jewellery somewhere deep in and around Homesteads. Do you think you can help find it? It means a lot to me and also keeps werewolves at bay. You need a dog and a shovel, but a good one! Find it for me, and I promise to love you lots and lots and not ever pour custard down your pants. And maybe even if you are wearing them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_END |= You found it! I would give you a hundred kisses if your face didn't look like a melted candy squirrel! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_END |= This necklace means a lot to me. It was given to me by my grandma Nora. She loved jokes too. She died trying to make us laugh by sledging down a hill in an offering bowl after drinking the last of our summer wine. It was a foggy day, and sadly the hill stopped and became a cliff, and over she shot.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_BELLE_PEPPER_END |= I remember the last thing she said like it was yesterday - "Weeeehoooooaaaggghhh! She was so batty.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_FRIENDLY |= So lovely to have a friendly and seemingly sensible person to chew the fat with. I need someone to be a calming kitten in a storm of Barghests.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_FRIENDLY |= He didn't always use to be this way. He was a miserable bugger back in the day, but an "experience" involving a flatulent cow and a candle nearly killed him and bizarrely made him appreciate fine farts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_FRIENDLY |= I preferred when he was glum to be truthful.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_LIKE |= If I ever get into bed and lay on a poopee pouch again, I swear by Hyalis deathly glare that I will send the prankster flying through the nearest window.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_LIKE |= Am I just being a killjoy?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_LIKE |= I was brought up as a sensible girl. Always please and thank you's and mind how you sit and don't swallow your food.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_LIKE |= My toe is itching, and I think it's itching to kick somebody, so they flip into a big pile of fertiliser.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_NAME |= Prank Poppyhill for Carolina
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_DESC |= Ride a sheep with the Flatulence trait to designated points in Poppyhill. Feed the sheep something with that Trait contained within.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_START |= Could you help me? I'll love you for it. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_START |= I think I need to embrace the dragon while simultaneously putting a "Kick Me" sign on its back.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_START |= I am a bit nervous, though, about causing any bother, so maybe you could kick the dragon in the bangers instead? Basically, I want to stop being Mrs Serious and start being Little Miss Chief..
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_START |= I was thinking you could give some laxatives to a sheep and ride it through Poppyhill. That could be fun! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CAROLINA_PEPPER_START |= I can then experience the prank by proxy. You are a star.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_FRIENDLY |= Friends it is! I am amazed I haven't driven you bonkers with my antics! I just love a good joke and like a bit of PUN-ishment. There's nothing I won't make fun of. It's only jokes! I don't mean any harm, unlike your face. Bosh! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_FRIENDLY |= But seriously, for a second, no, I could never be serious for a second. I think you are a good sport, although you can tell I don't do any sport by my figure. All bought and paid for!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_LIKE |= What do scarecrows wear to keep warm? Harvest. A vest! Get it?!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_LIKE |= Well, your reaction is like a teacher who talks about water in buckets. Speaks volumes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_LIKE |= No good? Any laughs at all in there?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_LIKE |= I would love to dream up a really good prank. One that innovates. Something to push the boundaries of japes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_LIKE |= I need to go think! I find that truly good ideas are like the baths I have... rare!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_NAME |= Prank Summerdown
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_DESC |= Pour honey or poo in all marked areas in every house in Summerdown.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_START |= Can you say this? Peter Pepper picked a pricky puck a prickly pickled pepper?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_START |= Oh yes before I forget. I thought up my prank master plan. I just need a fit and able person who I like very much to help me pull it off. Do you know any fit and able people I like?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_START |= Ha! It's you, really!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_START |= My plan is this. Pour a bucket of poo or jar of honey into every house in Summerdown. If you can pull that off, then you would be officially a member of the Peter Pepper Lonely Farts Club Band.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_END |= You are a prank master! You should go to the Mirryr and get judged by the Goddesses.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_END |= The only problem is, you'd break it!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PETER_PEPPER_END |= It's going to be great having you as a true friend and fellow practitioner of punnetry and prankery.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_FRIENDLY |= Hey, you are a silky-voiced siren. Are you so flirty with everyone you meet, or do I sense something special going on?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_FRIENDLY |= Well, I'm feeling a delightful tingle in my throat that makes me want to sing, so I'm happy to meet you all the same.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_LIKE |= What do you think you will come back as after you pass into nature? 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_LIKE |= I think I would make a beautiful bird. Something colourful with a wonderful song.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_LIKE |= My parents taught me how to sing. My father was a bard, and my mother was a songstress. We travelled the land and lived off what people would throw at us.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_LIKE |= I didn't say my parents were any good. We had a largely rotten fruit diet until they let me perform.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_NAME |= Serenade Poppy Seed
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_DESC |= Take Poppy to the Lover's Laugh in Loverwood and play the lute. Use the Follow command on interact to lead her.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_START |= And so your music unlocks my soul and rests there. You have a way of connecting that makes a girl want to lead you to a quiet meadow and lay amongst the bluebells as I listen to your song.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_START |= Would you do that? Would you take me to a secret glade and fill my heart with your music? Can I be your muse?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_START |= A girl might then know of the sweetest songs and find true joy.
NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_SONG_1 |= Oh, joyous joys. A girl's heart has melted.
NPCSTORY_POPPY_SEED_SONG_1 |= Fold me in your glittering musical wings, flutterer of hearts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_FRIENDLY |= Someone who wants to be Roger's friend and not a lover? That's a new one to me.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_FRIENDLY |= I am mildly confused because, well, look at this face. It's gorgeous.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_FRIENDLY |= I don't need to work hard to look this good. Fresh air and the occasional eel for dinner keep me so incredibly handsome.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_FRIENDLY |= I know I sound a bit conceited, and I am, which is why my head is so large.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_FRIENDLY |= I just know that when it boils down to it, most Quillian's were drawn ugly. Or should that be born?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_FRIENDLY |= No idea why I said that.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_LIKE |= I feel we have a growing bond. If you ever find you can't perform certain duties, you should see a doctor, no? They may prescribe some chubby broccoli. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_LIKE |= When it comes to love, never say never again. With your golden eyes, which will be diamonds forever, the world is not enough.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_LIKE |= The spectre of age catches up with us all, but you only live twice, so why not live and let die and enjoy the pleasures of life? 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_LIKE |= It's an odd job, but someone has to do it!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_NAME |= Roger Readily needs some assistance
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_DESC |= Dig up a Lover's Truffle for Roger. Have a dig around some muddy patches around Cunning Plots. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_START |= I have a secret I can't bear to keep anymore!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_START |= Despite my stunning looks and remarkable loving techniques, lately, my libido is having a libido-go.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_START |= I need something to help me rediscover my mojo and regain some confidence. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_START |= There's a truffle, buried deep, that boosts virility like a boot up a chicken's backside.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_START |= You might need a pig to sniff them out, but they are out there and the only thing that can help give me the lift I need.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_END |= You found one! A Lover's Truffle! Your digging has dug me out of a hole, and I'm eternally grateful.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_END |= This whole drama has given me time to reflect, though. I don't give up my real feelings easily, so it is strange for me to have emotions of true friendship, as I do with you.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_END |= I thought life was just for the service of wooing and that my role in the world was all about my looks and abilities.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ROGER_READILY_END |= It took you to open my eyes to all the other beauty that surrounds us! And like everything else in Quill, I'm not getting any younger!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOM_COWE_FRIENDLY |= You don't seem so bad as I first thought. And on that thought, I am thirsty. Time to punish myself for being friendly with a nice strong drink, the drink that makes problems go away.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOM_COWE_LIKE |= I used to be a miner, you know? Yep, I worked down in Crumblechalk. Then I ran into the Knockers. You should see em! They rushed me, and I blacked out. Since then, I just couldn't handle going back in. Mining was my life. Now all I have to get me into the deep dark is the lovely soft embrace of Copperpot Red.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOM_COWE_NAME |= Get a 5-Star Rainbow Mushroom for Tom
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOM_COWE_DESC |= Get a 5-Star Rainbow Mushroom for Tom
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOM_COWE_START |= I have been drinking a lot. It is amazing where your mind goes; the more powerful the drink. I searched and searched for something that could take me further. The further I went, the clearer the vision. There is a place called Oblivion, at the rim of the sky. In that place, according to a scroll of the elders, is the answer I seek. My family don't want me getting drunk anymore though, so I have to find an alternative method for getting entry to Oblivion! It would have to be a top-quality item, such as a 5-star Rainbow Mushroom.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_TOM_COWE_END |= Well, wrap me in bread and roll me down the hill! The mushroom! It worked! My mind leapt into Oblivion and saw things you people would never believe! Dragons on fire off the shoulder of Hyalis. I watched baked beans glitter in the dark near the Tanning House Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like piss in the wind. And then a voice, running like a blade up my spine, screamed, "Wake up, you bloody idiot!" The shock brought me home, and now I can't ever touch strong drinks or mushrooms again. It has cured me. I am clear and clean, and life is wonderful once more. Thank you. How, er, will I ever repay you? Ah yes, take this!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JEREMIE_SMITH_FRIENDLY |= You will have to excuse me sometimes. I get such terrible headaches from banging away on the forge all day. I do love my work, though. The smell of the furnace and feeling the heat of the coals. Seeing metal shaped to become something useful and beautiful is where I am happiest.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JEREMIE_SMITH_LIKE |= You must excuse me yet again. Bit of a throbbing headache. I think the better my work, the more powerful the headache. Geoffrey tells me I should put corks in my ears, but I need to hear the sound of my forging. It is all about the timing, the pressure, the sound. Beauty comes at a cost.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JEREMIE_SMITH_NAME |= Cure Jeremie of Strained
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JEREMIE_SMITH_DESC |= Cure Jeremie of Strained. You can buy a cure or craft it at an Apothecary.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JEREMIE_SMITH_START |= I really can't take much more of this headache I'm getting from blacksmithing. I tried various remedies from the apothecary, but I am sure they are just giving me placebos or cures for bad wind.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JEREMIE_SMITH_START |= Could you see if you can find me a remedy? I'll give you something to help your own smithing as a reward.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JEREMIE_SMITH_END |= Oh, bless you! That worked a treat. It's like a weight has been lifted off my brain. Now I can stop those silly thoughts about hammering my own head. Just kidding! I'd stick it in the forge instead.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JOHN_BOWS_FRIENDLY |= [LETTER]NPCSTORY_JohnBows_1
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JOHN_BOWS_LIKE |= I gave a rose of romance to Lucy, but she rejected me. She says she is too busy with important work.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JOHN_BOWS_LIKE |= I was made to be alone, it seems. I have decided that one cannot simply walk into marriage. However, I will be hopeful she will one day look at me in the same way she looks at those relics. And at least I have you as a great friend, so that helps warm the hut at night.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JOHN_BOWS_NAME |= Take John Bows to Cuckoo Wood
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JOHN_BOWS_DESC |= Get John Bows to follow you using the Follow command. Take him to The Cuttings in northwest Cuckoo Wood.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JOHN_BOWS_START |= Your friendship means so much to me. Could I show you something? It's the place where I first saw Lucy. I think it might be of some interest to you and could be really useful. It's in Cuckoo Wood.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JOHN_BOWS_END |= Oh yes! The secret. See those old stumps? If you pour liquid on them, then come back the next day, you will find a moss has grown that is very useful. Try varying liquids for different mosses. And bring a sickle to harvest! Here, try some, and thanks for your friendship.
NPCSTORY_JOHN_BOWS_1 |= This is the place. It's so beautiful here. That's where she stood, examining various trees. Her hair shone in the moonlight. Such a sight. Ahhhh so dreamy...
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_WORZEL_SCRUMPY_FRIENDLY |= You seem ok. Are you interested in mining by any chance? I am a farmer by trade, but I always fancied digging up some treasures in Crumblechalk. Knockers put me off, though. Will probably stick to farming. I seem to have a decent orchard, don't you think?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_WORZEL_SCRUMPY_LIKE |= My boys are like chalk and curdled milk. Different sides of different coins. One would happily stay on the farm and stay up to his knees in muck. The other is all fanciful and dreams of adventure. I suppose they both have a bit of me in them. I like a simple life, but that mine keeps calling.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_WORZEL_SCRUMPY_NAME |= Explore the mine in Crumblechalk
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_WORZEL_SCRUMPY_DESC |= Go to the central locked door in the Crumblechalk region above the pond, and the door should automatically unlock. Enter the mine and head to the marked area.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_WORZEL_SCRUMPY_START |= I'd be a good friend to you if you helped me scratch my itch. So take this key and head into that middle mine above the pond in Crumblechalk. Let me know what you find. If it's good to go, then I might just as well get out the old pickaxe and head in to finally find my fortune!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_WORZEL_SCRUMPY_END |= What did you find in the mines? Knockers? Ghosts? Worse? Now look, <PlayerName>. I've been thinking about it whilst you were exploring, and I was tending to my apples. To be honest, I prefer fresh air and being alive. You can keep the key. Anything you find down there is yours, but there's probably nothing but death or worse!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JED_SCRUMPY_FRIENDLY |= My Dad runs the biggest farm in Quill. Got the best orchard and everything. Don't let those Cowe's tell ya different. Our mine is way bigger than theirs too. Did ya know there are Knockers down there? Pop is more scared of them than anyone else in Quill.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JED_SCRUMPY_LIKE |= People get me all wrong ya know? They say I am too competitive. Rubbish! I am the most uncompetitive person in Quill! Ned is a dreamer, and I am fully awake. He thinks I am dumb, and if I was, I'd be way dumber than that idiot.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JED_SCRUMPY_NAME |= Take Jed into the mine
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JED_SCRUMPY_DESC |= Take Jed into Festival Green Mine and find the marked area.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JED_SCRUMPY_START |= If you truly want to be my friend, then let's do something fun. Take me with you down the mine in Festival Green. Dad says there's a way down to even deeper places there. I want to go further than Dad ever did!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JED_SCRUMPY_END |= Well, you kept your promise. I was pretty brave, I think. Definitely the bravest in Quill.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JED_SCRUMPY_END |= If you keep my bravery to yourself, you can have this.
NPCSTORY_JED_SCRUMPY_1 |= Bugger that for a game of Apple Slap! Can you hear those noises?! I ain't going any further, get us out of here!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_FRIENDLY |= 오래된 무덤 옆에서 무지개버섯을 씹던 이야기를 들려줄게! 한 남자가 머리 없는 채로 무덤을 걸어가는 걸 봤어. 게다가 나는 그 사람을 꿰뚫어 볼 수 있었어. 그는 나무로 걸어가더니 허리를 굽히고 머리를 집어 들었어. 그리고는 그 머리를 들고 호수 속으로 사라졌어.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_FRIENDLY |= 내가 아무에게도 말하지 않은 이상한 점이 뭔지 알아? 사실 무지개버섯을 좋아하지 않아.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_LIKE |= 너와 나는 불타는 말처럼 잘 지내고 있어. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_LIKE |= 말이란 무엇인가? 집채만 한 고대의 돼지로, 사람이 탈 수 있었어. 바람처럼 빨랐지.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_LIKE |= 공동묘지에서 무지개버섯을 정리할 때 맹세컨대 한 번 본 적이 있어. 제 바로 앞을 지나가면서 불을 뿜었지. '우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우우' 같은 소리를 냈어.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_LIKE |= What struck me as odd is that it seemed to be trying to tell me something, but what on earth does 'Weeeeoooooohhhhaaaahhhh' actually mean?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_NAME |= Dig up the Ward in Burial Grounds
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_DESC |= Get a dog to follow you and a shovel (don't get the shovel to follow you) and search the Burial Grounds for digspots. You will see a little mound after the dog says WOOF WOOF and digs at an area. Just use your shovel on that small muddy mound.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_START |= I want to tell you something. I am only telling this to you as we are now the best of friends.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_START |= I once saw Mag the Moghog in Cuckoo Wood. I cut through some strange purple plants and found some curious structures. Mag was there, asleep.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_START |= I made a note of my experience in this book. You can have it, seeing as we are pals. You know that you can hand over items at Mag, and it'll spit back the same item, only better?!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_START |= I only ask one favour.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_START |= I dare not dig up any of those old graves, but the trouble is, I once buried a Tin Ward there out of superstition, and now I need it back. I fear I may have upset the spirits or Goddesses by burying it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_END |= Thanks for that! Did you see anything strange whilst digging around the graveyard? Did anything try to grab your ankles?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_END |= Haha! Only joking. They would probably try to bite, not grab.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_JACOB_CRACKLE_END |= You should come around here more often. The whispers can be quite soothing.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HAZEL_NUTT_FRIENDLY |= You look like you could be a trustworthy cat lover. Am I right? I do hope so. There are three things in this world you can rely on. Cats. More cats. And milk.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HAZEL_NUTT_FRIENDLY |= I once dated a fella who I hoped would show me the world and then lift me on his shoulders so I could touch the stars. All he ended up doing was eat fruit and read books on the toilet. Then, one day, he had gone. I like to think he flushed himself.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HAZEL_NUTT_LIKE |= I remember when I got my first cat. This lovely fluffy one on my head. I found him standing on a book in the outhouse, looking lost. So I took him in.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HAZEL_NUTT_LIKE |= It smelled of Hugh, my vanished fella. And then it furballed from there. I took in every stray I could find. Every stray man, I mean. And when each man left me, I would find another lost cat in their place. I had found a calling to care for them. A cat-calling, as it were.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HAZEL_NUTT_NAME |= Use the cursed outhouse.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HAZEL_NUTT_DESC |= Use the cursed outhouse by Hazel Nutt's house. You must have the Flatulence trait applied.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HAZEL_NUTT_START |= With all my fellas disappearing from the outhouse, I've come to the conclusion that my toilet is cursed. Could you lift the curse by blasting away the man-hating spirit that seemingly haunts within it? Plumbing not your thing? You might need some apothecary-based help, perhaps?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HAZEL_NUTT_END |= You did it? That must have been good exorcise. It is very much appreciated. My cats thank you, too. Hopefully the curse is gone for good and I might actually keep a man for more than a few flushes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_FRIENDLY |= I suppose you are one step closer to our inner circle. We are very picky who we let get to know us. People are jealous of our wealth and influence. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_FRIENDLY |= Do you know, though, that Rock and I built our fortune through hard work and toil in the copper mines? 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_FRIENDLY |= Yes! Unbelievable, I know to think that someone like me could swing a pickaxe, but I did. How I managed to keep my soft hands intact, I will never know!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_LIKE |= I like that you work hard and always seem to be moving. It's like you have an endless list of tasks keeping you busy. I appreciate a hard worker.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_LIKE |= Unfortunately, I feel that Rock and I were cursed with a child who wants for nothing. He wants everything. We should really teach him the joys of earning your rewards. You seem to understand that to get rewards, you must put in a bit of elbow butter.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_NAME |= Take Roman to pick Copper ore
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_DESC |= Take Roman to pick five lumps of Copper Ore. Use the Follow command on interact.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_START |= Would you do me a favour?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_START |= Roman is a layabout child. I think he needs to experience hard work and get a sense of who his family were.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_START |= So, to that end, could you take him on a tour of the mines and get some ore while he watches?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_START |= Five lumps of Copper will do.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_END |= Thank you. I hope that opens his eyes a bit to what toil is.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_END |= I know I could have taken him, but I felt a bit lazy, to be honest
NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_1 |= That doesn't look much fun.
NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_2 |= What's that noise?
NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_3 |= It's too cold in here. Can we go home?
NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_4 |= You smell of sweat.
NPCSTORY_CELIA_SALT_5 |= Is that copper ore? Looks like a rock.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_FRIENDLY |= Am a bit surprised you want to talk to me. I am not the most cheery of people.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_FRIENDLY |= Is there even any point? Look at me. I live in a hovel, grow turnips on a wasteland and have to look across the river at those horrible Lawns!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_LIKE |= It wasn't always like this, you know? We used to have a lovely farm, but then those Lawns moved in and diverted the river and used all sorts of tactics to sabotage us.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_LIKE |= We couldn't compete with their money. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_LIKE |= I fell off the wagon then. Broke my arm. After that, I couldn't farm as well as I used to.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_LIKE |= Sat drinking turnip starshine. Yes, it is as horrible as it sounds.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_LIKE |= So here I am now, just waiting for the Goddesses to turn me into fertiliser.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_NAME |= Grow Funflowers for Dick
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_DESC |= Grow 12 Funflowers for Dick. You will need 3 packets of Funflower seeds. Use the 12 plots next to Dick's house.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_START |= You are the only outsider who ever gave me time. I love Kat and Luca and always will. I just wish I could find a way to get out of my rut.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_START |= I did hear that the Fae have a flower that lifts the spirits... a type of funny sunflower, I think?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_START |= If I had my crop squares full of those, I reckon that might do the trick! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_START |= Yes, I am hinting.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_END |= I feel so much better already! Money can't buy you happiness, but funny certainly can!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_END |= When I see those flowers dancing, my soul feels like dancing along too.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_END |= All this has made me see the wood through the trees. What is important in life are great friends like you, family, fun and laughter.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DICK_TURNIP_END |= I am a much richer man than those bitter buggers across the way. So stick their money where Solus don't shine! Laugh is for the living!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_FRIENDLY |= You are a hero! Capital of you to become my ally in these dark times.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_FRIENDLY |= Do you want to join in my fantasy, fighting all manner of monsters?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_FRIENDLY |= From the forest where doom awaits to dungeons full of deathtraps and swamps full of scorpions... adventure awaits on every page!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_FRIENDLY |= The books, of course! I just love these books where you choose your own path without crossing any legal boundaries.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_FRIENDLY |= One minute, you could be raiding tombs, and the next, in a snowy cavern having tea with a witch.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_FRIENDLY |= And by tea, I mean whacking her with a big plus 3 sword called Witchbonker.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_LIKE |= You remind me of a character in this book, 'The Shirley Temple of Terror'. It's about a little girl who tries to take over the world with a voice that can shatter the armour off noble warriors.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_LIKE |= The character you remind me of is called Combman the Barber. I think it's because their hair looks just like yours. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_LIKE |= Anyway, I must continue. I have the one-fingered bookmark ready for when I get killed. In the book, I mean. I am about to challenge Zxjegcsciennkj the Unpronounceable to mortal combat. He's a street fighter with some gilty gear, and it's the final fight against him.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_NAME |= Find the lost book
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_DESC |= Find the lost book in a mine in Mellowfields and return it to Eun.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_START |= I have a quest for you, mighty friend.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_START |= There is a book I seek, lost deep within the Temple of Terry. The books I have collected tell you clues as to where you can find the last book in the series, and I worked out that it is located deep in a mine somewhere in Mellowfields, not an actual crypt.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_START |= Would you quest for it? I would go, but I have a bad back and a gammy leg despite my vast adventuring knowledge. In no way am I scared of dark dungeons. I mean mines. Nice, easy, unscary mines.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_END |= It does exist! The lost book! And in pretty good condition! So I shall begin my quest forthwith. I shall get my best dice and lose myself in the labyrinth of these pages.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_EUN_LIVINGSTUN_END |= You are indeed the true hero.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_FRIENDLY |= Why would you befriend a bonkers old loner like me? Are you after my lucky charms?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_FRIENDLY |= Or even my unlucky charms?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_FRIENDLY |= I sit alone at night watching the corn flake in the fireplace, hunched in my shreddies... the snap and crackle of the fire as I pop tarts into my mouth.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_FRIENDLY |= I bet people think I am a cereal killer.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_FRIENDLY |= Anyway, cheerio.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_LIKE |= Ohhhh, sing-a-long with me... 'Hedgehog, hedgehog on your kite, Like a shadow in the night'. Oh yes, I forgot, you already know I am not eccentric!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_LIKE |= I do still think you are after my charms, though. I have so many in the house to protect me from everything from mischievous weevils to evil Ken Evil, the daring devil.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_LIKE |= My parents were wanderers and sold charms and wards to the folk of Quill. I just loved the jangly sounds they made as our little pig-pulled cart ambled through the land, the trees as our bedposts.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_NAME |= Take the ransom
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_DESC |= Throw a cooked food item into the marked area below the twin waterfalls in The Shingles at night.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_START |= I have lost one of my lucky charms! It was a charm to protect against losing charms.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_START |= Will you help me? I found a ransom note under my pillow, not in my handwriting at all.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_START |= Could you do the 'drop'? It has to be at night in The Shingles by the Twin Waterfalls. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_START |= The note says to throw a cooked food item on the designated spot, and then the charm will be thrown over the waterfall.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_START |= Come alone or with a follower/pet and no fuzz, so shave first.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_END |= Wasn't that fun?! It wasn't really a charm that protects against losing charms. I could never truly lose that one.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_END |= Oh, the games we hermits play to pass the time.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_END |= I once challenged a ladybird to a game of Pants Burn! I somehow lost when my pants were set on fire.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_END |= However, I do love a good game of Hermits & Herbivores, Worms & Stepladders and my absolute favourite, Crying Alone Again.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_FROGG_THE_HERMIT_END |= Anyway, love you lots, do visit again, and whenever you hear a tinkle in the trees, it is someone having a wee.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_FRIENDLY |= A friend in the hand is worth two in the bush, I always say.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_FRIENDLY |= I lived here all my life, and when the old folks popped off, I was alone for a while.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_FRIENDLY |= Then Rake turned up in town, and we just got on right away. He had a way of trading that I hadn't seen before. We set up a market stall, then eventually bought ourselves a shop. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_FRIENDLY |= Rake did the selling, and I handled the books. We made a great team, and you know what they say about teamwork? Me neither.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_LIKE |= A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, I always say. But with the chain that you and I are making, that weakest link is strong.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_LIKE |= There's no 'I' in team, but if we pull in the same direction, we'll go the right way.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_LIKE |= I have no idea what I am talking about. I read about it in a business book.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_LIKE |= My whole life has been about just following the flow and freely living by what books tell me I should do.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_NAME |= Find the lost book
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_DESC |= Find the lost book in a cave or mine somewhere in Summerdown.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_START |= It is better to have laughed and loved than to never have loved at all, I always say.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_START |= I really must stop quoting from books!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_START |= I heard there was a book that helps you free yourself from reading books.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_START |= 'A dummies guide to dummies'. A wanderer told me about it. Says he was reading his copy in a cave while he sheltered somewhere in Summerdown. Forgot to take it with him. Said I could have it if I found it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_START |= If you come across it on your travels, I would be eternally grateful. Well, grateful until I die, at least..
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_END |= You got the book! Thanks muchly!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_END |= I shall read it in bed tonight, and hopefully, I can be free of having books forming who I am.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SPROUTS_ONIONS_END |= No more quotes for me! As they say, "Freedom is a carrot that... oh hang on...
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_FRIENDLY |= You seem like a good egg. I grew up on a chicken farm. Every day we had eggs. At least we didn't have to shell out for any. My pops used to say, "Eggs are great", which wasn't very profound, really. When the chickens ganged up and killed him, Mother said we should leave our home and set up a new business in his honour. Instead, we decided to open a tavern in hers.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_LIKE |= You know what I fancy right now? No, not an egg.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_LIKE |= A really nice drink.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_LIKE |= My mom used to drink Toebiter with every meal. Breakfast? Fried eggs on toast with Toebiter. Lunch? Scrambled egg with Toebiter. Dinner? Toebiter and egg stew.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_LIKE |= The weird thing is, although she stank of the stuff, she was never drunk. Instead, she was as bright as a button and happy as an egg in a pot.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_NAME |= Honour the Buckle parents
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_DESC |= While a chicken is nearby, throw an egg into the marked area in Outlane at Old Lady Falls.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_START |= I want to commemorate my folks but can't really take time off from pretending to run the pub. Do you think you could go to Old Lady Falls in Outlane, over in Mellowfields, and chuck some eggs in? Mother used to love visiting there. Oddly, that's how she died. She tripped over a chicken and fell in.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_START |= She might have floated but refused to let go of the keg she carried with her everywhere.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_START |= If you could throw an egg or two in, in the presence of a chicken, then that would be a really nice gesture.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_END |= Was it a beautiful tribute? Did the chicken shed a tear? Did the egg bounce realistically?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HARRY_BUCKLE_END |= I bet it looked funny. Haha! Gotcha! I tricked you. Dad didn't really get murdered by chickens, and Mum wasn't a beeraholic! Haha! It was the other way around. Dad drowned, and Mum got pecked to death. I love you for being such a good sport. Not laughed this hard since my grandma fell into Old Lady Falls. Yes, well, she actually did.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ICABOD_MOON_FRIENDLY |= I didn't always want to be a shopkeeper, you know? When I was a lad, I wanted to be an adventurer. I would leap around with my wooden sword and chop the heads off deadly dandelions. So it is just unfortunate that one day while I was fighting a bush beast, I was actually attacked by a vicious blue goblin thing. It ran at me yelling, and I was out of there faster than you can pass a prune pie.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ICABOD_MOON_FRIENDLY |= So that put an end to my dreams. Sad eh?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ICABOD_MOON_LIKE |= I've been thinking more about that vicious blue goblin who shattered my dreams of being an adventurer all that time ago. We are friends now, so I don't mind telling you this - I'm thinking about getting myself a sword and visiting that nasty little brute in Simplewood. I'll frighten him, the stumpy blue toilet pot.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ICABOD_MOON_NAME |= Get Icabod a copper sword
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ICABOD_MOON_DESC |= Get Icabod a copper sword. You can buy one or craft one or even win one!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ICABOD_MOON_START |= I both trust and admire you now, in equal measure! So, I have taken inspiration from your drive and energy and will strive to be the warrior I always dreamed of. I will face off against those denizens and have at them. If you could get me a sword, that would be good as I am too scared to ask the smithy.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ICABOD_MOON_END |= That is a good sword! Ok, I am going now! Right now! See you soon with a bagful of monster parts! Blue brute parts!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_FRIENDLY |= You are now friends with the greatest influencer in all of Quill! My beauty product knowledge is unequalled. I spread word of my homemade creams and tonics via Blogs.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_FRIENDLY |= I tell Joe Blogs, and he goes and tells everyone else.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_FRIENDLY |= Would you like to take a shelfie with me? We stand by a shelf of my products, and someone paints our portrait.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_FRIENDLY |= No? Another time then!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_LIKE |= You know how dyes are made, right? We crush insects to create them. You can get the most amaaaaazing colours!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_LIKE |= I talk all about it on YoTube. I stand on a crate in the village and shout "Yo!" through a tube, then tell everyone about my creams.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_LIKE |= You can't buy my products, by the way. Why would I let anyone else use them? They are just for clout. If anyone upsets me, I clout them over the head with a cream pot.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_NAME |= Gift Dee fae dyes
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_DESC |= Gift Dee Spencer Green Dye, Pink Dye and Blood Red Dye.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_START |= Now we are best pals; I can let you in on a secret. I heard about some coloured dyes we can't get in Quill. They are from far away places, and I have no time to find them, as I need to stream. Yes, that involves standing in a shallow river.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_START |= A person with my reputation has to keep being cool!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_END |= You got them? Wonderful! I shall use these to create my piece of resistance.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_END |= My followers will love it. Yes, I get followed by mice who love the smells of the things I create.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_DEE_SPENCER_END |= Thanks again. You are a star in the making.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_FRIENDLY |= Hey friend! It's good to get to know someone who is a little bit different.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_FRIENDLY |= Oh, I have heard all the rumours and stories about you. News travels fast. By fast, I mean quite slowly. We get all our gossip from outside sources, such as wandering traders and inquisitive wanderers. It's not every day you meet immortal cultists. That's right! We are really a kind of cult. I will have to tell you more sometime.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_LIKE |= Oh yes, I was going to tell you a bit more about our ways.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_LIKE |= Well, our ancestors, the ones who got lost in the swamp, were people who loved to create art, make costumes, have colourful hair and enact battles against monsters.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_LIKE |= This was just before the catastrophe and the Fae spilling into the world.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_LIKE |= Stranded here, my ancestors kept up their ways and passed the knowledge down.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_LIKE |= The cave where they lived has long been swallowed up by the marshes, but it would be a holy site to us, were it to ever be uncovered.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_NAME |= Dig up the Relic
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_DESC |= Get a Shadderwryth shovel and dig up the relic. Set the task as Active and head to the large Fae tree in Frogmarsh. Take a dog to find the dig spot and dig.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_DESC |= Then take the Relic to Lucy Arrows.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_START |= Our friendship is spectacular, is it not? Well, let me confide in you something.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_START |= A few years ago I found a relic of the old Age. At first I was filled with wonder, but then I panicked at holding such potentially forbidden knowledge. So I buried it deep beneath the Faery tree in Frogmarsh.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_START |= Its very presence there still makes me uncomfortable, and it feels like a waste of such a precious item. Could you dig it up and maybe give it to Lucy Arrows in the Vale? I was told she collects such items of antiquity. She may be able to tell you more about it too!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_END |= Oh, thank you! And that is very interesting what they said about the relic. I bet this land has a lot of such things hiding under the soil. Many thanks, friend.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAGE_ONION_ON_DELIVERY |= Amazing! What an interesting find! This is a kind of book that charts the life of some ancient hero. See his red cape? And how he wears his underpants on the outside? Sadly, some of the writing is now illegible, but look at that city! The ancients must have built houses to the sky. Incredible. I shall study it more, thank you!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAVEN_LOON_FRIENDLY |= I like you. You definitely have a dark streak inside you, I can sense it. Not many folks like me for being who I am and liking what I like. What is wrong with being fascinated by night and dark things and horrors and the dead? Nothing at all! Why do people love flowers, cats and butterflies? Just think about those things! True horrors, the lot of them.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAVEN_LOON_LIKE |= I found out that people used to write stories about horrible things, and they were called horror stories. We still tell ghost stories around here, but apparently, these were tales of gore and terror.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAVEN_LOON_LIKE |= I write my own and keep them hidden away because nobody would understand, especially Sal.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAVEN_LOON_NAME |= Give Raven 5 x Black Dye
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAVEN_LOON_DESC |= Acquire 5 bottles of Black Dye and gift them to Raven.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAVEN_LOON_START |= You are the greatest friend a freak like me could have. What would really seal the deal is if you could get me a stock of Black Dyes. Five bottles should do.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAVEN_LOON_END |= Just what the darkinator ordered! Only Sal knows my secret but you can know too, seeing as I trust you. I am really a blonde! That's why I need these dyes. I have to keep up disappearances.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_RAVEN_LOON_END |= Thanks again. May Morwenna bless your scary eyes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CHARLOTTE_ONION_FRIENDLY |= It's nice to have a new friend. I haven't had any for a long time. Immortality isn't all that great, really. I remember when we got our 'blessing' from Morwenna. It was on my 18th birthday, coincidentally. Quite a present! One day reaching adulthood, and then discovering that you will be an adult forever. I wish it had happened when I was a child.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CHARLOTTE_ONION_LIKE |= Do you like my eyes? Apparently I was born with deep emerald green eyes. Green as the moss that grows on the trees of the marsh. The marsh gas makes our eyes go pink over time. It makes me feel down sometimes that I have changed but through no will of my own. I don't feel like the person I want to be. Think about it... I am an 18-year-old going on 100. Have actually lost count of my real age.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CHARLOTTE_ONION_NAME |= Take Charlotte to The Shoe
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CHARLOTTE_ONION_DESC |= Take Charlotte to The Shoe, north of Homesteads through the cave. Get Charlotte to Follow using the interact command. Take her to the marked area in The Shoe region.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CHARLOTTE_ONION_START |= It is great that you genuinely care for me. There are no other people that understand me. Lewis is fun, but he is just not serious about life at all. He remained acting his age, whereas I have changed, even though my body hasn't.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CHARLOTTE_ONION_START |= I do want to feel that burst of youth again though. I want to be carefree. Could you take me to The Shoe? I heard it's where there are lots of children. I just want to hear their laughter and soak in that youthful spirit.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_CHARLOTTE_ONION_END |= Perhaps I don't have to worry about age at all. If my heart is that of a child, then so be it. Being old is no barrier to fun. I feel like I could say something profound now, but I don't think whoever scribes my thoughts is up to the task.
NPCSTORY_CHARLOTTE_ONION_1 |= Oh this is amazing! There's such an energy here. It is a pity that most of the children are playing inside that big old shoe, but you can feel the spirit of joy in the breeze. I feel invigorated, thank you so much. I don't know why I am giving you those Leeks as a reward, though. I do carry some random stuff around!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_FRIENDLY |= It's very nice of you to want to befriend me. The only person I really talk to is Dad.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_FRIENDLY |= He is a superb smithy and so strong. I would say I want to be like him when I grow up, but I sort of stopped growing up when we gained Morwennas Blessing.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_FRIENDLY |= It's not really a blessing as such is it?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_LIKE |= When I was little, Dad gave me a hammer for my birthday. It was made from the gold of Pineshade. Useless for smithing, but so beautiful.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_LIKE |= I hit my thumb with it once and saw Dad looking at me. I held in my pain and I could see it made him happy. He has no time for babies. Literally. When I was a baby he would be working and Mum would care for me.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_LIKE |= An Ogyr bashed her skull in when I was 5.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_NAME |= Kill an Ogyr
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_DESC |= Got to Toughwood and slay an Ogyr, then return to Gage.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_START |= I had a brainwave!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_START |= What would really make Dad proud is if I could give him some Ogyr Blood. I could say I killed one in revenge for Mum. It would make him so proud.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_START |= I definitely can't kill an actual Ogyr though. Toughwood is no place for anyone!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_START |= Would you do it? Could you do it? Slay an Ogyr for me?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_END |= You are a true wonder! Ogyr slain for friendship! Dad will love this.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_END |= Please take the hammer he gave me. He actually doesn't realise I still have it; he thought it was lost long ago. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GAGE_MAKER_END |= I don't think he actually really pays attention to that kind of thing. He is a man of deed.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_FRIENDLY |= How are you getting on with my son, Gage?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_FRIENDLY |= He's really trying hard to impress me, bless him. He has such a talent for smithing, but he does not believe that. He needs to realise that the world is at his feet, should he wish to place it there!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_FRIENDLY |= 부담스럽게 해서 미안해! 사실 너를 잘 모르지만 때로는 귀를 기울이는 것이 좋아.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_LIKE |= Smithing is really for the strong. Gage and I have a workout routine and strict diet. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_LIKE |= Want to know our secret?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_LIKE |= Eggs! Eggs and meat! And milk!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_LIKE |= It's a pity Woemarsh was so underserved in the past, but since it opened up to the outside world, we have got our grimy hands on all manner of goods.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_LIKE |= Look at our muscles now! Like a sock full of boulders.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_NAME |= Give Mason 10 Pork Chops
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_DESC |= Gift 10 Pork Chops to Mason Maker of Copperpot.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_START |= I will keep this short, as I am a simple man with simple needs.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_START |= You want my friendship, and I need pork chops. Ten of them, if you please?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_MASON_MAKER_END |= Woah! This is the stuff! Pork Chops will put hairs on your chest. I need that, as mine often get singed off by the forge!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_FRIENDLY |= Your eyes are really nice, if I may say? Mine lost their original colour when I was little. They say it's an effect of the marsh gas over time. This place is a bit unusual, isn't it? Our hair, eyes, the way we stopped ageing. It didn't always use to be like this. We are the lucky generation.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_LIKE |= I used to love playing at being a shop owner when I was little. I would make perfume by putting flower petals in water and sell refreshing drinks from a little stall I made from an old crate and some discarded ribbons.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_LIKE |= I say refreshing... it was undrinkable.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_LIKE |= However, years later, I made my fortune selling it as a fantastic floor cleaner and paint stripper.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_NAME |= 펄을 윌로우다운 농장으로 데려가기
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_DESC |= 상호작용 명령을 사용해 펄이 따라오게 한 후 윌로우다운 농장으로 데려가세요. 펄을 고리로 표시된 3 지점으로 데려가세요.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_START |= I was thinking about being young again. There is a legend about a ring of statues that can do such a thing, but I don't think I would want to physically change. The thoughts and memories I have warm me in my bed at night. Nostalgia nourishes me.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_START |= Could you show me where you grew up? Take me on a tour of this farm you own, so I can absorb the spirit of the place.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_END |= Thank you so much for that wonderful tour. It was delightful to see how the other half live. It will inspire my thoughts, dreams, drawings and writings for years to come!
NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_1 |= Oh, isn't this beautiful? We don't have fruit trees in Woemarsh. So fresh and vibrant. The smell really clears my nose of that stodgy marsh gas.
NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_2 |= So you used to come here and plant your seeds and lovingly water them? This is good soil, unlike that acidic muck we get back home. A person could really put down some deep roots in soil like this.
NPCSTORY_PEARL_ONION_3 |= Well, isn't this charming? Looks like the kind of place where adventures begin, and dreams are made. The sound of the waterfalls, the whispering trees, the smell of the lavender. I could close my eyes now and never want to wake.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_FRIENDLY |= You are a nut for trying to befriend me, you know? Nobody in town really cares much for me because I'm the joker of the pack. That's why I live out here by myself. I can scheme and plot some quality pranks. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_FRIENDLY |= We are all descended from fun lovers, not boring old sun lovers. What is life if not for having fun? It gets boring after decades of the same-old, same-old. I am old, but I don't want to grow up!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_LIKE |= Can I tell you a secret? When I was little, and we hadn't been blessed yet, my mother showed me a book she had hidden. It was an heirloom that was passed down through our family. It was called Peter Pan. It was about a really annoying boy who never grew up. He had a pet fairy, and he fought adults with his sword.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_LIKE |= I always wanted to be just like him. I will never fly, though.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_NAME |= Take Lewis to The Dancers
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_DESC |= Get Lewis to follow you using the interact command and take him to the marked area in The Dancers, north of FineFayre in Mellowfields.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_START |= I want to be a little boy again. Paige told me about The Dancers, somewhere west of Mellowbrook. It's a creepy stone circle of statues, and legend says they can make someone young again. Take me there, and we can be friends eternally!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_END |= Thank you for accompanying me. You are a true legend. I promise not to put beetles in your underpants.
NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_1 |= Oh my! I have changed my mind! This place gives me the creeps. I just pictured myself as a small boy with no parents, living alone in the marsh. All my childhood anxieties returning. All the nightmares I couldn't control. 
NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_1 |= The enormity of how small I was hit me hard, man.
NPCSTORY_LEWIS_FLUSHING_1 |= Adulthood ain't as bad as I make out.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAL_LOON_FRIENDLY |= I have run this tavern for well over a century now, and I still love it as much as when I first opened it. It used to be really busy, but as the people of Woemarsh vanished over the years, it became abandoned. I decided to take it over and spruce it up, and when we were connected to the outside world, it became a watering hole for traders, wanderers and the curious.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAL_LOON_LIKE |= How do we cope with being near-immortal? By being close friends and enjoying our gifts. This village used to be much bigger, but many couldn't cope, and they walked into the mists or Dreadwaters on purpose. Those with willpower and spirit stayed on, and finally, we were shown a path outside by Morwenna. Some left to wander the land, but a few of us stayed. We are the hardcore, through and through. Woemarsh 4 life!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAL_LOON_NAME |= Take a pig to Copperpot Tavern
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAL_LOON_DESC |= Ride or get a pig to follow you to the back room in the tavern within Copperpot.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAL_LOON_START |= I think more people need to experience my special brews and also the greatness that our village has to offer. Did you know we have pipes that heat and light our homes? No other place in Quill has our advancements, and it was my father, Wilf, who created them. He sadly died when he lit his pipe too near a gas source, and the resulting bang made him fall off his stilts and into a vat of tar. And that is why we should never smoke. It's the tar that kills you.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAL_LOON_START |= Anyway, I had an idea to serve food... in a pub! Crazy, I know. If you bring me a pig, our friendship is secured.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_SAL_LOON_END |= Excellent! Now I can train this pig to serve customers' salads. I am going all vegan, so those pork chops are on the house. Not literally, before you even think about joking.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_FRIENDLY |= It's great to make a new friend; especially one from so far away. It was only in recent times that Woemarsh was made accessible to all, and we started to stray from our little community. We have been around a long time, thanks to our blessing, but we were shut off from the outside world.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_FRIENDLY |= Once I got out there, I discovered so many amazing goods, and so my store thrived.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_LIKE |= I like how adventurous you are. As you may have noticed, we of Woemarsh are a bit quirky. It's all in our ancestry. For so long, we have been stuck in these marshes, thinking we are alone in the world, except for old Daddy Long Legs, but he's not exactly the kind you want to talk to!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_NAME |= Take Ava to the 3 locations
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_DESC |= Take Ava to the marked locations in the 3 locations she mentions...
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_DESC |= A woodland with dancing statues in Mellowfields...
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_DESC |= An ancient graveyard in the Vale...
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_DESC |= A woodland with poppies where sweethearts go in Summerdown.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_START |= This may seem a bit forward of me, but would you take me to some places I have never been?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_START |= I read about a glade of strange dancing stones somewhere in Mellowfields, and a place in your Vale where an ancient religion lay buried. I also heard tell of a beautiful woodland in Summerdown where lovers walk amongst the giant poppies.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_END |= Thank you for showing me the stranger places in the world. I think there must be a reason why we prefer our home of Woemarsh! Stay safe out there.
NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_1 |= This is so mysterious! Do you wonder why they are here? They actually creep me out a bit! Let's get out of here.
NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_2 |= Oh, another mysterious and creepy place. They actually put their bodies into wooden caskets and buried them? How will their souls get out? I don't like it! Let's get out of here.
NPCSTORY_AVA_GANDER_3 |= Ah, this is a beautiful place, but why the phallic statues? I get a feeling here that we are being watched. Don't you feel it too? It's like eyes on us from every bush. It's suffocating. Let's get out of here.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ISIAH_GREEN_FRIENDLY |= Well, I am surprised that you wish to grow our friendship. Not many folks around here like our ways.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ISIAH_GREEN_FRIENDLY |= It's all Theresa. She insists on us being the most faithful. But unfortunately, faith is not something I have in abundance. Just don't tell her I said that.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ISIAH_GREEN_LIKE |= Can I confess to you? I just cannot hold it in much longer. Every day I am told to look up at the sky and revere our Goddesses. I can't see them, though, and I certainly don't feel them. I long for them to reach down and touch me, but they never do. Theresa is a good woman at heart, but her heart and hands became cold long ago.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ISIAH_GREEN_NAME |= Get a Lover's Truffle for Isiah
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ISIAH_GREEN_DESC |= Gift Isiah a Lover's Truffle
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ISIAH_GREEN_START |= Could you help me? I really want to help Theresa be like the girl I knew when we first met. She could sing the hairs off a pig's back and we broke many a bedspring.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ISIAH_GREEN_START |= It must be me. Years of devout worship has stopped me from worshipping myself. Any vigour I had has dried up. I know that Lover's Truffles are meant to be great for boosting one's abilities in certain areas. Maybe that will stoke the coals a bit. I want to not see the trees for the wood. Help me get one of those rare things, and I will be in your service.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ISIAH_GREEN_END |= Thank you so much! I know these are hard to get, a bit like my problem, eh? I still have a bit of lightning in my old bottle, thanks to you! 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_FRIENDLY |= Do you think me too serious? Do you think me too uptight? Then that is good. Most people here treat life as a frivolous journey and do not contemplate the meaning of their being. Even Isiah cannot keep his eyes on the sky. I have seen his eye wander, and he should fix his gaze lest that eye be torn out!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_LIKE |= Why have the wicked not been punished? Why do the Goddesses let men be drunk and lay with another at will? Why does nobody really fear sacrifice? Am I the only one even trying? Perhaps my way is the wrong way. Do you think I have lived my life hiding from the ghosts of truth? Don't answer that. I think I just answered it myself.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_NAME |= Take Theresa to other Havens
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_DESC |= Get Theresa to Follow you and take her to the marked areas in the following locations...
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_DESC |= \nRivermoor
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_DESC |= \nOutlane
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_DESC |= \nThe Circle
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_DESC |= \nFrogmarsh
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_DESC |= \nLoverwood
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_START |= I have decided I need to get away and see the beauty of the world. I think it will be good for my soul. It would be lovely if you would accompany me on a trip to see the other havens. For too long, I have been stuck in the Vale. The only time I went elsewhere was to worship. Let's go to each haven and let my soul take in the beauty that the Goddesses have given us.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_END |= What a beautiful world we live in! I feel refreshed and reborn. My love for the Goddesses is recharged, and I shall sing their praises rather than mumble them through clasped hands. Please take this as a token of my gratitude.
NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_1 |= What a wild land this is. So bleak, yet so intoxicating and peaceful. I can hear the voices of the Goddesses in the wind.
NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_2 |= What a quiet and serene place. It's no wonder that hermits retreat here. One can be at one with themselves and nature.
NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_3 |= This is so wonderful! There is an ancient power here I can feel in my bones. The majesty of the wilderness makes you dizzy.
NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_3 |= I feel like the presence of the Goddesses is very strong here. It's like you are standing at a gateway to many places, both real and spiritual.
NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_4 |= Can you hear that? It's the sound of life continuing to thrive in secret pools and under the roots.
NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_4 |= Some may think this is a harsh place, but I love the song of the natural world here. I almost feel compelled to just walk into those dark waters and sing with them.
NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_5 |= What joy! When Isiah and I married, we came here, but the colours seem much more vivid now. He took me to a secret glade, and we lay under the stars, and the Goddesses winked at us.
NPCSTORY_THERESA_GREEN_5 |= We had no favour from them, but it was a fun time, at least.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_FRIENDLY |= Well, hey ho and hi ho silver lightning, it's away we go. I can tell our friendship is at the start of a long and beautiful journey. That or a quick trip around the block, eh?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_FRIENDLY |= Have you ever wanted to be a smith? I couldn't lift a hammer if I tried. I did try to lift a hammer once, but Jeremie shouted, "You can't touch this!" He is very protective. I like feeling safe and secure. I also like feeling other things if you catch my meaning?! Wahey! I mean fine fabrics, of course. I always fancied being a tailor. Pity there are no marriable Mr Tailors around, eh? *wink*
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_LIKE |= Poor Jeremie. He keeps getting the most awful headaches. It is very inconvenient! I told him he needs to pop some nice little corks in his ears, but he looks at me as if I came into his forge at Summertide and used his tongs to curl my hair.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_LIKE |= It really is affecting our friendship. One day he will listen or just become deaf!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_NAME |= Catch a butterfly
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_DESC |= Catch any type of butterfly and release it in the marked area in the forge.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_START |= It has come to a head... ache. Jeremie keeps saying worrying things. I think he may do something silly, like slice his bread or take the fat off his meat.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_START |= Could you be an absolute love and help me? I asked Lucy Arrows about the Fae, and she says that there is a legend that an insect that will fly into your ear and soothe you like nothing else in Quill. A butterfly, I believe. Good luck!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GEOFFREY_BLACK_END |= Bless you, sweetheart! I am soooo impressed! He is already saying the pains have gone, and all he can hear is the sweet music of the forge. Please take my precious ring as thanks. You are a star fallen from Aurore's bosom or wherever she keeps her stars.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_FRIENDLY |= You seem to be a good sort. I'm sorry about all that unfriendliness due to that accursed Unwell.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_FRIENDLY |= You did a great thing sorting that out.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_FRIENDLY |= I have seen Daddy Long Legs a couple of times through the trees. A tall spindly figure stalking Dreadwaters at night. The candles keep him at bay. I quite like the smell of them. They certainly smell better than some of the dank waters in the marshes.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_LIKE |= I heard you have a folklore fellow that runs around the Vale. Tickling Tom Hookfingers is his name. He sounds terrifying! Have you ever seen him? Did you try hitting him with your slingshot as he runs away? It sounds such a thrill!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_LIKE |= I have always loved the unnatural. Ghosts, spirits, monsters, unusual legends. My favourite has to be Shuffling Nana, but she is far, far to the north, and ever since the dragon attack, the bridge is down, and nobody dare repair it! That really hurts trade.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_NAME |= Find the Legendary book
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_DESC |= Find the invisible book in the Tomb in Dreadwaters.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_START |= You are so great. You know what I would love? I would get my hands on a copy of Folklore & Legends by Sue Pernatural. It's a book I have always wanted. It is actually a bit of a legend itself as it is said one copy exists, and that copy was lost. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_START |= There is one teeny tiny problem potentially though.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_START |= I was over at Paige's house, and she told me about it, and I read some books and one thing led to another and... well, it's apparently in *cough*Dreadwaters*cough*.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_START |= Sorry. Yes, a journal from a tomb raider called Clara Loft mentioned she found the book in Daddy Long Legs tomb. She apparently tripped over something invisible, and when she shone her magical lantern on it, the book appeared. She was disturbed by Daddy, literally, and fled, leaving the book behind.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_START |= So, if you can just hop along and find it and not die in the process, I'd be your fan for life.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_GOOSE_GANDER_END |= Incredible! Just how did you get this? And it's actually signed by the author. This is priceless, but you have my love and take this 250 Brass. Can't wait to read it! It even has colour illustrations! Woohoo!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_FRIENDLY |= Druida, smile on you. I can tell you have a good heart. We try to keep pure of heart, mind, spirit, and body in the Brown household. That all starts with a good diet. Fruits, grains and a bowl of kindness go a long way to feeding one's soul. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_FRIENDLY |= Arthur used to be a voracious meat-eater, but after he met me, I showed him a better, healthier and more spiritually satiating way.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_FRIENDLY |= He was all meat and two veg, but now he is definitely a man who doesn't touch a sausage.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_LIKE |= Arthur is really struggling with the way of life we have. He often vanishes, but I usually find him in the old den or by our little pond. And he has a smell about him. It is quite fowl. And by that, I mean chickeny.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_LIKE |= I may be being paranoid, but I once found feathers when washing his underwear. Although, come to think of it, he did seem tickled pink just before that. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_LIKE |= But, heh, it's all fine, really. Forget I mentioned it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_NAME |= Throw a Pork Chop into the Pool
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_DESC |= Go to the Pool of Passing at the Burial Grounds and throw a Pork Chop into it, of course. Use the Thatterway if you need to locate it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_START |= May I discuss something? It is a little bit, shall we say, sensitive and requires discretion.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_START |= I caught Arthur in our cellar with a pork chop draped over his face. When I confronted him, he broke down and told me he just wanted a sample of something meaty, as he misses it but doesn't want to upset me. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_START |= I think we need to get rid of that stuff once and for all. Could you go into our store just below our house and take that damnable pork chop? I am convinced it is cursed and has put a spell on him.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_START |= Then, go to the Pool of Passing at the Burial Grounds, where the funerals take place and throw it in there. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_START |= Thank you.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_THERESA_BROWN_END |= Thank you for doing that with the pork chop! Out of sight, out of mind as I always say! May the Goddesses bless you.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_FRIENDLY |= Herbert has no friends. Yet Herbert thinks you could be a friend. You know Fae. Maybe you could help Herbert one day. Herbert will think about it.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_LIKE |= Herbert has something to tell you, yes he does. Herbert told nobody else. Nobody listens to Herbert. 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_LIKE |= Herbert's father is a Fae! Yes, it is true! Herbert has Fae blood! That's why Herbert lives so long!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_LIKE |= Herbert has a father who raised Herbert, and he told Herbert that he was different and special. Herbert's mother is dead now. She got eaten by monsters in the dark forests, yes! Herbert swore to protect the Vale from monsters, so Herbert built the wall and guards it day and night. No more mothers eaten!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_NAME |= Track down Herbert's father.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_DESC |= Search Tir Na Nog for the locked door and find the Gnome.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_START |= Herbert wants to ask a favour. Herbert has been thinking about his Dad. Could you find him for Herbert? He is a Fae. You go to Fairy lands and find him? Herbert would be grateful. Before you go, I have something that may help. This key was left to me. Herbert thinks it will help you find Herbert's Dad.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_END |= Returned you have! And with news? 
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_END |= It's true! Herbert has Fae blood! Nobody believed old Herbert, and they never will. Herbert happy though. Maybe father will be free to visit one day.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_END |= Herbert likes you very much for helping. Take these and don't ask where I kept them!
NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_GNOME |= Are you him? You look far too young to be him. Are you Herbert?
NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_GNOME |= You are not? Then how did you get the key?
NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_GNOME |= Oh I see.
NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_GNOME |= Yes, it is true. Herbert is the offspring of myself and the human woman I fell in love with. Honey Lemon was her name. The Gnome Council found out and banished me into this cave for 150 years. It was a bit harsh, to be honest. I know for a fact that Gibble Wibblehorn got only five years banishment for putting laxatives in Sugar Plums. The Great Mess, they called it.
NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_GNOME |= Honey was eaten by monsters in one of the forests thinking she would find me there. Probably a trick by the Council to get rid of her. We Fae can be absolute gits sometimes.
NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_GNOME |= Being half-Fae means Herbert will live a tremendous amount of time, but the elder Gnomes hated that, and so they cursed Herbert with aged looks and body and left him in North Gate, seemingly a crazy man that nobody would believe. 
NPCSTORY_HERBERT_LEMON_GNOME |= Now, if you will excuse me, I need to soothe my plums.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_FRIENDLY |= Ooooh, you know what I fancy right now, friend? A lovely, juicy pear. Or a nice apple. I do like a bit of fruit. Nature's bounty, y'know? We Brown's just adore being part of the whole system. It's like - wooooahhh! Think about it, man. The apple grows, we eat the apple, our bodies take all the good and spit out the bad, and then that badness helps grow more apples.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_FRIENDLY |= Actually, when I put it like that, it does make apples seem less appealing.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_LIKE |= Oh man, I must tell you about a dream I had last night. I was in some cave, and all the animals I had ever eaten were there. They each, in turn, asked me to bite into them. They were competing to be the tastiest. But what is really strange is that I went to bed a little hungry and woke up completely full. That's like, wow, so freaky. Can we actually eat in our dreams and be nourished? Crazy.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_NAME |= Take Arthur Brown to Pig Auction.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_DESC |= Get Arthur to follow you to the Pig Auction and stand in the marked area.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_START |= I think I might need some help. My dreams have been getting increasingly vivid, and now I wake up sometimes with grass in my toes and dirty soles. I soon realised I was sneaking out at night to our underground store and sniffing pork chops. I couldn't bring myself to cook them up, though, as I know it would upset Theresa. Perhaps I need one moving experience to get it out of my system?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_START |= Could you take me to the Pig Auction on Festival Green when they are on? I think I need that to cure myself, no pun intended.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_END |= Woooahhh, that smell! It is absolutely disgusting. It has put me off pork for life, man.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_END |= I needed to clear my head, and this smell has cleared my head, nose, lungs and soul!
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_ARTHUR_BROWN_END |= Thanks for the help, friend.


STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_FRIENDLY |= It's nice to get to know you. A friend indeed is a friend indeed, or something like that.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_FRIENDLY |= Have you seen any strange goings on? Any small folk in pointy hats?
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_FRIENDLY |= I see... Can't say, eh? Sworn to Fae secrets! *wink*
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_LIKE |= I used to be completely mad for Fairies as a young girl. My dad told me he had a book of pressed Fairies somewhere in the house. It sounded grotesque! I could never find the book, though. I am beginning to think he might have been pulling my leg.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_LIKE |= Dad was always like that. Tall tales. Outlandish stories. I was entranced, though. That man could talk the hind legs off a Barghest.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_NAME |= Become a Gnome for Lucy
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_DESC |= Find a way to become a Gnome and talk to Lucy. There is a plant that apparently has these qualities... Once you have done this, go to the marked area in Lucy's house.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_START |= It would seem that we have become very close. In the time-honoured tradition, I think some task is in order.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_START |= As you know, I am obsessed with the Fae. I would love to meet a Gnome. Ever since I saw them, I just wanted to... ooooooh... grab their little rosy cheeks and ruffle their beards.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_START |= I mean, I would love to talk to them about their culture and home. Ahem. If you can just sort that out for me, I'd be grateful.
STORYTASK_NPCSTORY_LUCY_ARROWS_END |= I met a Gnome. Was very odd. But I guess you set that up. Thank you either way... it certainly passed some time. You are the best. Who needs Fae with friends like you?
